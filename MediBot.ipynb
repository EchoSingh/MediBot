Thestomach and intestines begin development outside thebaby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wallenclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical openingis too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-els or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through theabdominal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes for birth defects that still\\nremain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal walldefects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother mayhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetusare nondescript.\\nDiagnosis\\nAt birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of\\nthe umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worsecases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, anultrasound examination may detect the problem. It isalways necessary in children with one birth defect to lookfor others, because birth defects are usually multiple.\\nTreatment\\nAbdominal wall defects are effectively treated with\\nsurgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom-alies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated.The organs are normal, just misplaced. However, if thedefect is large, it may be difficult to fit all the viscera intothe small abdominal cavity.\\nPrognosis\\nIf there are no other defects, the prognosis after sur-\\ngical repair of this condition is relatively good. However,KEY TERMS\\nHernia —Movement of a structure into a place it\\ndoes not belong.\\nUmbilical —Referring to the opening in the\\nabdominal wall where the blood vessels from theplacenta enter.\\nViscera —Any of the body’s organs located in the\\nchest or abdomen.10% of those with more severe or additional abnormali-\\nties die from it. The organs themselves are fully function-al; the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen.The condition is, in fact, a hernia requiring only replace-\\nment and strengthening of the passageway throughwhich it occurred. After surgery, increased pressure inthe stretched abdomen can compromise the function ofthe organs inside.\\nPrevention\\nSome, but by no means all, birth defects are pre-\\nventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good nutri-\\ntion, supplemental vitamins , diligent avoidance of all\\nunnecessary drugs and chemicals—especially tobacco—and other elements of a healthy lifestyle.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nDunn, J.

Although D&X is high-\\nly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-tages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-stances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus isremoved largely intact, allowing for better evaluation andautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.\\nIntact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower riskof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Anotherperceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancywithout requiring the woman to go through labor, whichmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods oflate-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lowercost and shorter procedure time.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-versy common to all late-term abortions is whether thefetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’sbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is thatfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetalbody has exited the uterus. Several states have takenlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicianswho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This mayrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-ing late-term abortion.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves\\nadministration of medications to cause the cervix todilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, thephysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.The body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feetfirst, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,the physician uses an instrument to puncture the base ofthe skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, thecontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,which results in the death of the fetus, and reduces thesizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass throughthe cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is thenremoved from the woman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient\\nvisit to administer medications, such as laminaria ,t o\\ncause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local\\nlegal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,counseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewingstages of fetal development, childbirth , alternative abor-\\ntion methods, and adoption.KEY TERMS\\nCervix —The narrow outer end of the uterus that\\nseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.\\nFootling breech —A position of the fetus while in\\nthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearestthe cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exitthe uterus, with the head of the fetus being the lastpart to exit the uterus.\\nLaminaria —A medical product made from a cer-\\ntain type of seaweed that is physically placed nearthe cervix to cause it to dilate.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-\\ntal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled tomonitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion\\nis performed, the more complicated the procedure andthe greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition toassociated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk ofinjury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, bloodclots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,and anesthesia-related complications. There is also a riskof incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is notdead when removed from the woman’s body. Possiblelong-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant orcarrying a future pregnancy to term.\\nNormal results\\nThe expected outcome of D&X is the termination of\\na pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from thewoman’s body.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nEpner, Janet E., et al. “Late-term Abortion.” JAMA 280, no. 8\\n(26 August 1998): 724-729.\\nSprang, M.

Dugan, M.S.\\nAbortion, selective\\nDefinition\\nSelective abortion, also known as selective reduc-\\ntion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in amulti-fetal pregnancy , to decrease the health risks to the\\nmother in carrying and giving birth to more than one ortwo babies, and also to decrease the risk of complicationsto the remaining fetus(es). The term selective abortionalso refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such asthe woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be bornwith some birth defect or impairment, or because the sexof the fetus is not preferred by the individual.\\nPurpose\\nA woman may decide to abort for health reasons, for\\nexample, she is at higher risk for complications during preg-nancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes.\\nHowever, selective reduction is recommended often in\\ncases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more thanone fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In thegeneral population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in onlyabout 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan-cies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-ble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-able with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-ment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetalpregnancy and consider the prospect of recommendedreduction before undergoing fertility treatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successfulwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-dure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-dle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina andpotassium chloride is injected into the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction to\\nsafeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseledprior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-mation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy toboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risksafter the reduction.\\nIndividuals seeking an abortion for any reason\\nshould consider the ethical implications whether it bebecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because thefetus would be born with a severe birth defect.\\nAftercare\\nCounseling should continue after the abortion\\nbecause it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feelguilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mentalhealth professionals should be consulted throughout theprocess.\\nRisks\\nAbout 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-\\ntion will go into premature labor . About 4-5% of\\nwomen undergoing selective reduction also miscarry oneor more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associatedwith multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.\\nNormal results\\nIn cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or\\nmore fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typicallydevelop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKnobil, Ernst and Jimmy D.

Womenhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy wouldcause them hardship, endanger their life or health, orbecause prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will beborn with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the first\\nsix to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-culation of this date is referred to as the gestational ageand is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. Forexample, a woman who is two weeks late having herperiod is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is sixweeks since she last menstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.Abortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higherKEY TERMS\\nMulti-fetal pregnancy —A pregnancy of two or\\nmore fetuses.\\nSelective reduction —Typically referred to in cases\\nof multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetusesare aborted to preserve the viability of the remain-ing fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.rate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are\\nextremely rare and are usually limited to situations wherethe life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics or\\noutpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early inpregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlledepilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or whoare HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatientsif precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-vious endocarditis ,asthma , lupus erythematosus, uter-\\nine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-trolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usuallyneed to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-toring and medications during the procedure.\\nDescription\\nV ery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. Thisprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,mini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of theuterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastictube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suctionis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the “morning after” pill, or\\nemergency contraception . Basically, it involves taking\\nhigh doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours ofhaving unprotected sex. The high doses of hormonescauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-port a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it issimply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergency contraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, anduses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type isavailable with a prescription under the brand name Pre-ven. But women can even use their regular birth controlpills for emergency contraception, after they check withtheir doctor about the proper dose. About half of womenwho use birth control pills for emergency contraceptionget nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts therisk of pregnancy 75 percent.\\nThe other type of morning-after pill contains only\\none hormone: progestin, and is available under the brandname Plan B. It is more effective than the first type witha lower risk of nausea and vomiting . It reduces the risk\\nof pregnancy 89 percent.\\nWomen should check with their physicians regard-\\ning the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 9Abortion, therapeuticGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 9', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='brand of birth control pill.

Theadvantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:\\n• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments\\nare used.\\n• Anesthesia is not required.• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage .\\nDisadvantages of a medical abortion are:\\n• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-\\ngical abortion.\\n• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is\\nexpelled.\\nTwo different medications can be used to bring about\\nan abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-ping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.\\nOn the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives\\nan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, abouta week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), anoxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible forvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of theuterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel thecontents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that theabortion is complete.\\nWith this procedure, a woman will feel cramping\\nand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. Thiscombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in endingpregnancy.\\nMifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand\\nname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-esterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,then stimulates uterine contractions thus ending thepregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after thefirst day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit tothe doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two dayslater she returns and, if the miscarriage has notoccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes theuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need totake misoprostol. After an observation period, shereturns home.\\nWithin four days, 90% of women have expelled the\\ncontents of their uterus and completed the abortion.Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed theabortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-sary to confirm through observation or ultrasound thatthe procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, asurgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8percent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion\\nafter taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists inabout 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortionis recommended because the fetus may be damanged.Side effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavycramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor-mal period and may last up to 16 days.\\nMifepristone is not recommended for women with\\nectopic pregnancy , an IUD, who have been taking long-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 10Abortion, therapeuticUterus\\nEmbryonic\\ntissueVaginaVulsellum\\nCervixSpeculum\\nExtraction tube\\nBetween 5 and 7 weeks, a pregnancy can be ended by a pro-\\ncedure called menstrual extraction.The contents of theuterus are suctioned out through a thin extraction tube thatis inserted through the undilated cervix.

The procedure is also calleddilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu-um curettage, or suction curettage.\\nAdvantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:\\n• It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.• The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.\\n• The woman does not see the products of her womb\\nbeing removed.\\nDisadvantages include:\\n• The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used.• Infection may occur.\\nDuring a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix is\\ngradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into thecervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc-tion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con-tents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a womanfeels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is oftengiven to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterinecramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman mayreturn home.\\nSecond trimester abortions\\nAlthough it is better to have an abortion during the\\nfirst trimester, some second trimester abortions may beinevitable. The results of genetic testing are often not\\navailable until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especiallyteens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come toterms with it emotionally soon enough to have a firsttrimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-ing second trimester abortions.\\nSome second trimester abortions are performed as a\\nD & E. The procedures are similar to those used in thefirst trimester, but a larger suction tube must be usedbecause more material must be removed. This increasesthe amount of cervical dilation necessary and increasesthe risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctantto perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for somewomen is it not a medically safe option.\\nThe alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is\\nan abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may requirean overnight stay in a hospital.

Thedoctor will ask the woman questions about her menstrualcycle and also do a physical examination to confirm the\\nstage of pregnancy. This may be done at an office visitbefore the abortion or on the day of the abortion. Somestates require a waiting period before an abortion can beperformed. Others require parental or court consent for achild under age 18 to receive an abortion.\\nDespite the fact that almost half of all women in the\\nUnited States have had at least one abortion by the timethey reach age 45, abortion is surrounded by controversy.Women often find themselves in emotional turmoil whendeciding if an abortion is a procedure they wish to under-go. Pre-abortion counseling is important in helping awoman resolve any questions she may have about havingthe procedure.\\nAftercare\\nRegardless of the method used to perform the abor-\\ntion, a woman will be observed for a period of time tomake sure her blood pressure is stable and that bleedingis controlled. The doctor may prescribe antibiotics to\\nreduce the chance of infection. Women who are Rh nega-tive (lacking genetically determined antigens in their redblood cells that produce immune responses) should begiven a human Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) after theprocedure unless the father of the fetus is also Rh nega-tive. This prevents blood incompatibility complicationsin future pregnancies.\\nBleeding will continue for about five days in a surgical\\nabortion and longer in a medical abortion. To decrease therisk of infection, a woman should avoid intercourse and notuse tampons and douches for two weeks after the abortion.\\nA follow-up visit is a necessary part of the woman’s\\naftercare. Contraception will be offered to women whowish to avoid future pregnancies, because menstrualperiods normally resume within a few weeks.\\nRisks\\nSerious complications resulting from abortions per-\\nformed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of womenwho have abortions in this time period, 2.5% have minorcomplications that can be handled without hospitaliza-tion. Less than 0.5% have complications that require ahospital stay. The rate of complications increases as thepregnancy progresses.Complications from abortions can include:\\n• uncontrolled bleeding\\n• infection• blood clots accumulating in the uterus\\n• a tear in the cervix or uterus\\n• missed abortion where the pregnancy continues• incomplete abortion where some material from the\\npregnancy remains in the uterus\\nWomen who experience any of the following symp-\\ntoms of post-abortion complications should call the clin-ic or doctor who performed the abortion immediately.\\n• severe pain\\n• fever over 100.4°F (38.2°C)• heavy bleeding that soaks through more than one sani-\\ntary pad per hour\\n• foul-smelling discharge from the vagina\\n• continuing symptoms of pregnancy\\nNormal results\\nUsually the pregnancy is ended without complica-\\ntion and without altering future fertility.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie A.

It is the resultof the body’s defensive reaction to foreign material.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 12AbcessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 12', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 6}), Document(page_content='Description\\nThere are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means that they are theresult of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immuneresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,white blood cells gather at the infected site and beginproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest bodytissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,and enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\\nbegins with a process called inflammation. Initially, asthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,several events occur:\\n• Blood flow to the area increases.• The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,\\nand other liquids.\\n• It turns red.• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and\\nthe chemical activity.\\nThese four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—\\ncharacterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of anabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefiesmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easilydigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath theskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skinrather than working its way through the skin where itcould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscessalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-toms just like any other infection. These include chills,fever , aching, and general discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the\\nsame process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin isnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and maycause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—sterile because there is no infection involved. Sterileabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps asthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.Causes and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria likeStaphylococcus aureus , which is nearly always the cause\\nof abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the largebowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused byany of the numerous bacteria found within the largebowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be causedby any organism that can travel there through the circula-tion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel inthis fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body arecaused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-tures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif-ic abscesses are:\\n• skin abscesses by normal skin flora• dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora• lung abscesses by normal airway flora, pneumonia\\ngerms, or tuberculosis\\n• abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel flora\\nSpecific types of abscesses\\nListed below are some of the more common and\\nimportant abscesses.\\n• Carbuncles and other boils . Skin oil glands (sebaceous\\nglands) on the back or the back of the neck are the onesusually infected. The most common germ involved isStaphylococcus aureus . Acne is a similar condition of\\nsebaceous glands on the face and back.\\n• Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect a\\ntiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal bac-teria can enter this opening, causing an infection andsubsequent abscess.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 13Abcess\\nAn amoebic abscess caused by Entameoba histolytica.\\n(Phototake NYC.

Recent or chronic dis-ease in an organ suggests it may be the site of an abscess.Dysfunction of an organ or system—for instance, seizuresor altered bowel function—may provide the clue. Pain\\nand tenderness on physical examination are commonfindings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan-nel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterileabscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but-tock where a shot was given.\\nTreatment\\nSince skin is very resistant to the spread of infection,\\nit acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals ofan abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus,the pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician.The surgeon determines when the abscess is ready fordrainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing thepus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaininginfection, sometimes with the help of antibiotics or other\\ndrugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth orrubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closingbefore all the pus has drained out.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIf an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be\\nslowly working its way through the skin as it is morerapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicalswork faster at higher temperatures, applications of hotcompresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten thedigestion of the skin and eventually result in its breakingdown, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment isbest reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan-gerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck.It is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their veryearly stages. It will “ripen” them.\\nContrast hydrotherapy , alternating hot and cold\\ncompresses, can also help assist the body in resorption ofthe abscess. There are two homeopathic remedies thatwork to rebalance the body in relation to abscess forma-tion, Silica and Hepar sulphuris . In cases of septic\\nabscesses, bentonite clay packs (bentonite clay and asmall amount of Hydrastis powder) can be used to draw\\nthe infection from the area.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce the abscess is properly drained, the prognosis\\nis excellent for the condition itself.

Turkington\\nAbuse\\nDefinition\\nAbuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri-\\nous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive andwrongful misuse of anything. There are several major typesof abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult,substance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse.\\nDescription\\nPhysical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by\\nan other person. The injuries can include punching, kick-ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.The physical abuse inflicted on a child can result inbruises ,burns ,poisoning , broken bones, and internal\\nhemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarilyoccurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-lence. It is estimated that approximately three millionchildren witness domestic violence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children, oneof whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexualbehaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-tocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can alsoinclude exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-tion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography is also used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%male. Females are more often perpetrators in child-caresettings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by afemale with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step-fathers is five times more common than with biologicalfathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers orfathers is the most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-tration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-tion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe-tration of an act of sexual intercourse whether:\\n• will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use\\nof drugs).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 16AbuseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 16', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='• mental impairment renders the victim incapable of\\nrational judgment.\\n• if the victim is below the legal age established for con-\\nsent.\\nSubstance abuse is an abnormal pattern of substance\\nusage leading to significant distress or impairment. Thecriteria include one or more of the following occurringwithin a 12-month period:\\n• recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill\\nobligations at home, work, or school.\\n• using substance in situations that are physically danger-\\nous (i.e., while driving).\\n• recurrent substance-related legal problems.\\n• continued usage despite recurrent social and interper-\\nsonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi-cant other).\\nAbuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly\\nas a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level ofdependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abusecan be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delayingor not reporting the need for advanced medical care.Elderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (moneyor possessions taken away) and abandonment.\\nEmotional abuse generally continues even after phys-\\nical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personallytailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic-it a provoked response.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildren who have been abused usually have a variety\\nof symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, andpsychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi-cally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,depressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, theyexhibit fear, anxiety , and nightmares. Severe psychological\\nproblems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumaticstress disorder. Physically abused children may complain\\nof physical illness even in the absence of a cause. Theymay also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil-dren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexualbehavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal.Adolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out,and—in some situations—homosexual contact.\\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately\\nlead to death . Approximately 50% of women murdered\\nin the United States were killed by a former or currentmale partner. Approximately one-third of emergencyroom consultations by women were prompted due todomestic violence. Female victims who are married alsohave a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious-KEY TERMS\\nEncopresis —Abnormalities relating to bowel move-\\nments that can occur as a result of stress or fear.\\nness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery).\\nPhysical abuse or rape can also occur between marriedpersons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu-ally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, anddebase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-lence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-ually assaulted persons were also physically abused in theform of punching, beating, or threatening the victim witha weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who arehurt and humiliated tend to physical assault personswhom they are intimately involved with, such as spousesand/or children. Males who assault a female tend to haveexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.They also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,and are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directedagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor thewomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolateother sources of protection and support. They interprettheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-ment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-ing control. Males may also use aggression againstfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly\\ncommunity. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care-taker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest-ing behavioral changes in the elderly person when thecaretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can bepossible if there are delays between injuries and treatment,inconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack ofhygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled.\\nDiagnosis\\nChildren who are victims of domestic violence are\\nfrequently injured attempting to protect their motherfrom an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspectionor self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also beevident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises orself report.\\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim.

Aceta-\\nminophen—or APAP—is sold under various brandnames, including Tylenol, Panadol, Aspirin Free Anacin,\\nand Bayer Select Maximum Strength Headache Pain\\nRelief Formula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, andsinus medicines also contain acetaminophen. Check theingredients listed on the container to see if aceta-minophen is included in the product.\\nStudies have shown that acetaminophen relieves pain\\nand reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But differencesbetween these two common drugs exist. Acetaminophenis less likely than aspirin to irritate the stomach. However,unlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not reduce the red-ness, stiffness, or swelling that accompany arthritis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe usual dosage for adults and children age 12 and\\nover is 325-650 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed. No morethan 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours.Because the drug can potentially harm the liver, peoplewho drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid-erably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid thedrug completely.\\nFor children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-\\n300 mg, three to four times a day. Check with a physicianfor dosages for children under age 6 years.\\nPrecautions\\nNever take more than the recommended dosage of\\nacetaminophen unless told to do so by a physician ordentist.\\nPatients should not use acetaminophen for more than\\n10 days to relieve pain (5 days for children) or for morethan 3 days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by aphysician. If symptoms do not go away—or if they getworse—contact a physician. Anyone who drinks three ormore alcoholic beverages a day should check with aphysician before using this drug and should never takemore than the recommended dosage. A risk of liver dam-age exists from combining large amounts of alcohol andacetaminophen. People who already have kidney or liverdisease or liver infections should also consult with aphysician before using the drug. So should women whoare pregnant or breastfeeding.\\nSmoking cigarettes may interfere with the effective-\\nness of acetaminophen. Smokers may need to take higherdoses of the medicine, but should not take more than therecommended daily dosage unless told by a physician todo so.KEY TERMS\\nArthritis —Inflammation of the joints.

Before having medical tests done, check tosee whether taking acetaminophen will affect the results.Avoiding the drug for a few days before the tests may benecessary.\\nSide effects\\nAcetaminophen causes few side effects. The most\\ncommon one is lightheadedness. Some people mayexperience trembling and pain in the side or the lowerback. Allergic reactions do occur in some people, butthey are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such asa rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after takingacetaminophen should stop taking the drug and getimmediate medical attention. Other rare side effectsinclude yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis-ing, weakness, fatigue , bloody or black stools, bloody\\nor cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amountof urine.\\nOverdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea,\\nvomiting, sweating, and exhaustion.

A ring of muscle called the lower esophagealsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance tothe stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contractedto close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, thecontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-gus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-tate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such asheartburn . The act of swallowing causes a wave of\\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushesfood along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes theesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-ach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” theesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-sis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve\\ncells that normally signal the brain to relax theesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-ation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-tion is suspected.\\nSymptoms\\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-\\nmon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-ally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,often feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. Theperson has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina\\npectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belchingare common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Othersymptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent\\npneumonia caused by food passing into the lower airways.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical\\nhistory. The history should focus on the timing of symp-toms and on eliminating other medical conditions thatmay cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnoseachalasia include:\\n• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is\\npassed into the esophagus to measure the pressureexerted by the esophageal sphincter.\\n• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to\\nact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines ofthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier tosee its constriction at the sphincter.\\n• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a\\nlight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy isused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.This test can also detect tumors that cause symptomslike those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs\\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-\\ntion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-loon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter andinflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effectivein about 70% of patients.\\nThree other treatments are used for achalasia when\\nballoon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.\\n• Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter,\\nbotulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it torelax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years.\\n• Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the\\nsphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.Esophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with thedevelopment of techniques allowing very small abdom-inal incisions.\\n• Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker,\\nreduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro-vides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as longas two years.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with achalasia can be treated effective-\\nly. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy unlessesophageal carcinoma develops.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 20AchalasiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 20', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content='Prevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent achalasia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGrendell, James H., Kenneth R.

The disorder appears in approxi-mately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia isusually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristicappearance of the newborn.\\nNormal bone growth depends on the production of\\ncartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci-um is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard-en and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalitiesof this process prevent the bones (especially those inthe limbs) from growing as long as they normallyshould, at the same time allowing the bones to becomeabnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of thebody and the skull are mostly not affected, although theopening from the skull through which the spinal cordpasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor-mal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which thespinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomesincreasingly and abnormally small down the length ofthe spine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAchondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is a\\ndominant trait, meaning that anybody with the geneticdefect will display all the symptoms of the disorder. Aparent with the disorder has a 50% chance of passing it\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 21Achondroplasia\\nAn x-ray image of an achondroplastic person’s head and\\nchest.

Although achondroplasia can be\\npassed on to subsequent offspring, the majority of casesoccur due to a new mutation (change) in a gene. Interest-ingly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one ofonly a few defects known to increase in frequency withincreasing age of the father (many genetic defects arelinked to increased age of the mother).\\nPeople with achondroplasia have abnormally short\\narms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as istheir head. The appearance of short limbs and normalhead size actually makes the head appear to be oversized.The bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear-ance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor-mal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays anoverly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel-opment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Becausethe foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormallynarrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord ornerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag-num may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between thebrain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulationof too much fluid in the brain ( hydrocephalus ). Children\\nwith achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious andrepeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear-\\ning loss . The disease does not affect either mental capac-\\nity, or reproductive ability.KEY TERMS\\nCartilage —A flexible, fibrous type of connective tis-\\nsue which serves as a base on which bone is built.\\nForamen magnum —The opening at the base of the\\nskull, through which the spinal cord and the brain-stem pass.\\nHydrocephalus —An abnormal accumulation of\\nfluid within the brain. This accumulation can bedestructive by pressing on brain structures, anddamaging them.\\nMutation —A new, permanent change in the struc-\\nture of a gene, which can result in abnormal struc-ture or function somewhere in the body.\\nSpinal canal —The opening that runs through the\\ncenter of the column of spinal bones (vertebrae),and through which the spinal cord passes.\\nVertebrae —The individual bones of the spinal col-\\numn which are stacked on top of each other. Thereis a hole in the center of each bone, throughwhich the spinal cord passes.Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is often made at birth due to the characteris-\\ntically short limbs, and the appearance of a large head. X-ray examination will reveal a characteristic appearance tothe bones, with the bones of the limbs appearing short inlength, yet broad in width. A number of measurements ofthe bones in x-ray images will reveal abnormal proportions.\\nTreatment\\nNo treatment will reverse the defect present in achon-\\ndroplasia. All patients with the disease will be short, withabnormally proportioned limbs, trunk, and head. Treat-ment of achondroplasia primarily addresses some of thecomplications of the disorder, including problems due tonerve compression, hydrocephalus, bowed legs, andabnormal curves in the spine. Children with achondropla-sia who develop middle ear infections (acute otitis\\nmedia ) will require quick treatment with antibiotics and\\ncareful monitoring in order to avoid hearing loss.\\nPrognosis\\nAchondroplasia is a disease which causes consider-\\nable deformity. However, with careful attention paid tothe development of dangerous complications (nervecompression, hydrocephalus), most people are in goodhealth, and can live a normal lifespan.\\nPrevention\\nThe only form of prevention is through genetic\\ncounseling , which could help parents assess their risk of\\nhaving a child with achondroplasia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHall, Bryan D. “Achondroplasia.” In Nelson Textbook of Pedi-\\natrics , ed.

Like allenzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-tions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnosewhether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the\\nbody (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness oftreatment. The test has been largely supplanted by theprostate specific antigen test (PSA).\\nPurpose\\nThe male prostate gland has 100 times more acid\\nphosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostatecancer spreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-\\nphatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads tothe bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who havemetastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphataselevels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reducedthrough treatment.\\nTissues other than prostate have small amounts of\\nacid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney,and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissuescauses a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.\\nAcid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.\\nRape investigations will often include testing for thepresence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acid\\nphosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer hasmetastasized.\\nDescription\\nLaboratory testing measures the amount of acid\\nphosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine fromwhat tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it isimportant to know if the increased acid phosphatase isfrom the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatasefrom the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase(PAP), is the most medically significant type of acidphosphatase.KEY TERMS\\nEnzyme —A substance needed to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions.\\nMetastasize —Spread to other parts of the body;\\nusually refers to cancer.\\nProstate gland —A gland of the male reproductive\\nsystem.\\nSubtle differences between prostatic acid phos-\\nphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues causethem to react differently in the laboratory when mixedwith certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi-cal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro-static acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos-phatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ-ences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos-phatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usuallyavailable the next day.\\nPreparation\\nThis test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.\\nThe patient should not have a rectal exam or prostatemassage for two to three days prior to the test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applyingpressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops willreduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site willrelieve discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in\\nmetastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the bone, suchas Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism ; diseases of\\nblood cells, such as sickle cell disease or multiple\\nmyeloma ; or lysosomal disorders, such as Gaucher’s dis-\\nease, will show moderately increased levels.\\nCertain medications can cause temporary increases\\nor decreases in acid phosphatase levels.

It occurs when thepores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skincells, and bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is\\nthe most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 millionpeople in the United States. While acne can arise at anyage, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during ado-\\nlescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some timebetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of womendevelop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-\\nface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s naturalmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles withinwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.These follicles open onto the skin through pores. Atpuberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)cause the glands to produce too much sebum. Whenexcess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, ahard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mildnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-dones, whiteheads and blackheads.\\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni-\\nbacterium acnes , a bacteria that normally lives on theskin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens\\nand bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin andwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamedpimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; whendeeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type ofacne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hardswellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laiddown to replace damaged cells.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the bodywhere the most sebaceous follicles are found.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk\\nfactors have been identified:\\n• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,\\nteenagers are more likely to develop acne.\\n• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have\\ngreater susceptibility to the disease.\\n• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-\\ntion, during pregnancy , and menopause .\\n• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may cause\\nflare-ups.\\n• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including\\ntranquilizers, antidepressants, antibiotics ,oral contra-\\nceptives , and anabolic steroids.\\n• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or\\npicking at pimples will make them worse.\\n• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen\\nacne.\\n• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,\\nand sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.\\n•Stress . Emotional stress may contribute to acne.\\nAcne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed\\nlesions may cause pain , tenderness, itching , or swelling.\\nThe most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-tive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Somepeople, especially teenagers, become emotionally upsetabout their condition, and have problems forming rela-tionships or keeping jobs.\\nDiagnosis\\nAcne patients are often treated by family doctors.\\nComplicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 24AcneGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 24', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 18}), Document(page_content='disease specialist, or an endocrinologist, a specialist who\\ntreats diseases of the body’s endocrine (hormones andglands) system.\\nAcne has a characteristic appearance and is not diffi-\\ncult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medicalhistory, including questions about skin care, diet, factorscausing flare-ups, medication use, and prior treatment.Physical examination includes the face, upper neck,\\nchest, shoulders, back, and other affected areas. Undergood lighting, the doctor determines what types and howmany blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed,whether they are deep or superficial, and whether there isscarring or skin discoloration.\\nIn teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,\\nnose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appeartowards the outer part of the face. Adult women mayhave acne on their chins and around their mouths. Theelderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on theupper cheeks and skin around the eyes.\\nLaboratory tests are not done unless the patient\\nappears to have a hormonal disorder or other medicalproblem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests maybe ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag-nosing and treating acne.\\nTreatment\\nAcne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc-\\ntion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria withtopical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choicedepends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, orsevere.\\nDrugs\\nTOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflamma-\\ntory acne consists of reducing the formation of newcomedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada-palene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effectivebecause it increases turnover ( death and replacement) of\\nskin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topicalantibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen.Improvement is usually seen in two to four weeks.\\nTopical medications are available as cream, gel,\\nlotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. Theyinclude antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery-thromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline(Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugsand open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin(Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci-nol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics andantibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid(Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza-mycin), are also used. These drugs may be used for\\nmonths to years to achieve disease control.\\nAfter washing with mild soap, the drugs are applied\\nalone or in combination, once or twice a day over theentire affected area of skin. Possible side effects includemild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increasedsensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.\\nORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for\\ntwo to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,erythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin-damycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole(Bactrim, Septra).

The vestibular and cochlearnerves lie next to one another. They also run along sideother cranial nerves. People possess two of each type ofvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the leftear and one that extends from the right ear.\\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information concern-\\ning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlearnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibularnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called amyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-times develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumoris an abnormal growth of tissue that results from theuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are oftencalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumorsthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds thevestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are consideredbenign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread toother parts of the body. They can occur anywhere alongthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where thevestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canalthat connects the brain and the inner ear.\\nAn acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-\\nlar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumoris a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumorarises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acousticneuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance).

A person\\nwith NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developingacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.\\nAcoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can\\ntake years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remainso small that they do not cause any symptoms. As theacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-tioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo andbalance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows largeenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing\\nlossand a ringing ( tinnitus ) in the affected ear will usu-\\nally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-ues to grow it can press against other nerves in the regionand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-ening if it becomes large enough to press against andinterfere with the functioning of the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or\\nabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in anerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes inevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. OneNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother andone NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of thefather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-vent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-ular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.\\nOnly one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is\\nnecessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-ma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing inone of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nervethen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-lateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genesbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someonewith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developedspontaneously is not at increased risk for having childrenwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-romas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is alsopossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may becaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-venting the formation of tumors.\\nBilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is\\naffected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person withNF2 is typically born with one unchanged and onechanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.Sometimes they inherit this change from their mother orfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously whenthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell ofthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-\\nma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-taneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheathcells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 oftendevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The meanage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years ofage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-mas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acousticneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk fordeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells.\\nMost people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are\\nnot affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlearnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-al tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve anumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-one under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-roma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma andother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably isaffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acousticneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataractsand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On theother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateralacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family historyof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with\\nthe functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The mostcommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearingloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-nitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes reportdifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceivingthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when theirhearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases thehearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually overtime until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-mately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.\\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of\\nthe vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve andvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent ofsmall tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, whichis characterized by dizziness or a whirling sensation.\\nLarger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigobut more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium,which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener-al feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of peoplewith an acoustic neuroma.\\nAs the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround-\\ning cranial nerves.

Duringthe ABR examination, a harmless electrical impulse ispassed from the inner ear to the brainstem. An acousticneuroma can interfere with the passage of this electri-cal impulse and this interference can, sometimes beidentified through the ABR evaluation.

DNA testinginvolves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou-tine blood draw for the common gene changes associat-ed with NF2.\\nTreatment\\nThe three treatment options for acoustic neuroma\\nare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physicianand patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ-ent options prior to making a decision about treatment.The patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumorsize, and tumor location should be considered.\\nMicrosurgery\\nThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the\\nmost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In mostcases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. Ifthe tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yetthere is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then onlypart of the tumor may be removed. During the procedurethe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance andgeneral anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranialnerves is done during the procedure so that damage tothese nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearingis a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also takeplace during the surgery.\\nMost people stay in the hospital four to seven days\\nfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes fourto six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and head\\ndiscomfort following the surgery. Problems with balanceand head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-tality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at mostmajor centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-ence some degree of post-surgical complications. In mostcases these complications can be managed successfullyand do not result in long term medical problems. Surgerybrings with it a risk of stroke , damage to the brain stem,\\ninfection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-nial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result fromthe surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one tofive years following the surgery because of possibleregrowth of the tumor.Stereotactic Radiation therapy\\nDuring stereotactic radiation therapy , also called\\nradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia-tion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi-ation is administered in a single large dose, under localanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. Thisresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but littleradiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-ment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.The goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or atleast limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-cy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of thepatient is therefore recommended.\\nRadiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can\\nsometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy canalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, whichcan result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysisof the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms aretemporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-tion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This typeof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-ment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-disposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.\\nObservation\\nAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in\\nsome cases they will stop growing and even becomesmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-priate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-odically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.Long-term observation may be appropriate for examplein an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma andfew symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-ed for someone with a small and asymptomatic acousticneuroma that was detected through an evaluation foranother medical problem. Observation may also be sug-gested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the onlyhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-ger of an observational approach is that as the tumorgrows larger it can become more difficult to treat.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-nosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Longterm hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com-mon, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Regrowth ofthe tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiationtherapy and repeat treatment may be necessary. The progno-sis can be poorer for those with NF2 who have an increasedrisk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 30Acoustic neuromaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 30', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content='Resources\\nBOOKS\\nFilipo, R., and Barbara Maurizio Acoustic neuroma: trends and\\ncontroversies: proceedings of the Symposium AcousticNeuroma: Trends and Controversies, Rome, Italy, Novem-ber 13–15, 1997.

The hands and feet turn bluebecause of the lack of oxygen. Decreased blood supplyto the affected areas is caused by constriction or spasm ofsmall blood vessels.\\nDescription\\nAcrocyanosis is a painless disorder caused by constric-\\ntion or narrowing of small blood vessels in the skin of affect-ed patients. The spasm of the blood vessels decreases theamount of blood that passes through them, resulting in lessblood being delivered to the hands and feet. The hands maybe the main area affected. The affected areas turn blue andbecome cold and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur.Emotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms,while warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seenmainly in women and the effect of the disorder is mainlycosmetic. People with the disease tend to be uncomfortable,with sweaty, cold, bluish colored hands and feet.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe sympathetic nerves cause constriction or spasms\\nin the peripheral blood vessels that supply blood to theextremities. The spasms are a contraction of the musclesin the walls of the blood vessels. The contractiondecreases the internal diameter of the blood vessels,thereby decreasing the amount of blood flow through theaffected area. The spasms occur on a persistent basis,resulting in long term reduction of blood supply to thehands and feet. Sufficient blood still passes through theblood vessels so that the tissue in the affected areas doesnot starve for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels nearthe surface of the skin are affected.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by observation of the main clini-\\ncal symptoms, including persistently blue and sweatyhands and/or feet and a lack of pain .

Both men and women are affected. Becausethe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-sis is often delayed. The majority of patients are notidentified until they are middle aged.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe pituitary is a small gland located at the base of\\nthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releasescertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important tothe functioning of other organs or body systems. Thepituitary hormones travel throughout the body and areinvolved in a large number of activities, including theregulation of growth and reproductive functions. Thecause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-duction of GH.\\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives input\\nfrom another brain structure, the hypothalamus, locatedat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. Forexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitaryto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should alsodirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.\\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH\\nand ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-likegrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growththroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stopproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormalpeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the bodybegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability toprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.\\nIn acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin\\nto grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,and forehead also grow, and facial features are describedas “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and becausethe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.Due to swelling within the structures of the throat andsinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-low, and patients may develop loud snoring . Various hor-\\nmonal changes cause symptoms such as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 32Acromegaly and gigantismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 32', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 26}), Document(page_content='• heavy sweating\\n• oily skin\\n• increased coarse body hair\\n• improper processing of sugars in the diet (and some-\\ntimes actual diabetes)\\n• high blood pressure\\n• increased calcium in the urine (sometimes leading to\\nkidney stones)\\n• increased risk of gallstones ; and\\n• swelling of the thyroid gland\\nPeople with acromegaly have more skin tags, or out-\\ngrowths of tissue, than normal. This increase in skin tagsis also associated with the development of growths,called polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-ally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly oftensuffer from headaches and arthritis. The variousswellings and enlargements throughout the body maypress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling orburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.\\nThe most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of\\npatients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-in the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumorsare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As thesetumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within thebrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interferingwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions maybe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle ofwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. Inrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production ofGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggersproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause acromegaly produces slow changes over\\ntime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, thecharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is oftennot recognized by family members, friends, or long-timefamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by anew physician who sees the patient for the first time andis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.Comparing old photographs from a number of differenttime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.\\nBecause the quantity of GH produced varies widely\\nunder normal conditions, demonstrating high levels ofGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis ofacromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring anincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are\\nuseful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-preted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 varywhen the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty , elder-\\nly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show adecrease in GH production when given a large dose ofsugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not showthis decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-duction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful\\nfor viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locatingan adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the searchfor a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of\\nall or part of the pituitary adenoma.

It ischaracterized by the presence of a lump or mass that oftenforms, draining sinus tracts to the skin surface. Fifty per-cent of actinomycosis cases are of the head and neck region(also called “lumpy jaw” and “cervicofacial actinomyco-sis”), 15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, andthe rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain. Men are threetimes more likely to develop actinomycosis than women.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nActinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium\\nActinomyces israelii . This bacterium is normally present\\nin the mouth but can cause disease if it enters tissues fol-lowing an injury. Actinomyces israelii is an anaerobic\\nbacterium which means it dislikes oxygen but grows verywell in deep tissues where oxygen levels are low. Tooth\\nextraction , tooth disease, root canal treatment ,j a w\\nsurgery, or poor dental hygiene can allow Actinomyces\\nisraelii to cause an infection in the head and neck region.\\nThe main symptom of cervicofacial actinomycosis is\\nthe presence of a hard lump on the face or neck. The lumpmay or may not be red. Fever occurs in some cases.\\nDiagnosis\\nCervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by a fam-\\nily doctor or dentist and the patient may be referred to an oralsurgeon or infectious disease specialist. The diagnosis ofactinomycosis is based upon several things. The presence of ared lump with draining sinuses on the head or neck is stronglysuggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent history oftooth extraction or signs of tooth decay or poor dental\\nhygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of thefluid draining from the sinuses shows the characteristic “sul-fur granules” (small yellow colored material in the fluid) pro-duced by Actinomyces israelii . A biopsy may be performed to\\nremove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure can beperformed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s office. Occa-sionally the bacteria can be cultured from the sinus tract fluidor from samples of the infected tissue.\\nActinomycosis in the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, or\\nbrain can be very hard to diagnose since the symptomsoften mimic those of other diseases. Actinomycosis ofthe lungs or abdomen can resemble tuberculosis or can-\\ncer. x-ray results, the presence of draining sinus tracts,\\nand microscopic analysis and culturing of infected tissueassist in the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nActinomycosis is difficult to treat because of its\\ndense tissue location.

Chinese medicine does not make as sharp adestinction as Western medicine does between mind andbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions andmental states are every bit as influential on disease aspurely physical mechanisms, and considers factors likework, environment, and relationships as fundamental to apatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very differentsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. WhileWestern medicine typically describes health as mainlyphysical processes composed of chemical equations andreactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi,and the organ system to describe health and the body.\\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\\nyang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down-ward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot,male, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.Nothing is either completely yin or yang. These two prin-ciples always interact and affect each other, although thebody and its organs can become imbalanced by havingeither too much or too little of either.\\nChi (pronounced chee, also spelled qior kiin Japan-\\nese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy.

Chinese medicine has developed intri-cate systems of how organs are related to physical andmental symptoms, and it has devised correspondingtreatments using the meridian and pressure point net-works that are classified and numbered. The goal of acu-pressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and unblockthe circulation of chi, by activating very specific points,called pressure points or acupoints . Acupressure seeks\\nto stimulate the points on the chi meridians that passclose to the skin, as these are easiest to unblock andmanipulate with finger pressure.\\nAcupressure can be used as part of a Chinese\\nphysician’s prescription, as a session of massage ther-\\napy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and ill-\\nnesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines apatient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental andemotional activity, taking the pulse usually at thewrists, examining the tongue and complexion, andobserving the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get acomplete diagnosis of which organs and meridianpoints are out of balance. When the imbalance is locat-ed, the physician will recommend specific pressurepoints for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure isrecommended, the patient might opt for a series oftreatments from a massage therapist.\\nIn massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate a\\npatient’s symptoms and overall health, but a massagetherapist’s diagnostic training isn’t as extensive as aChinese physician’s.

Then, the therapist will work\\nwith different meridians throughout the body, depend-ing on which organs are imbalanced in the abdomen.The therapist will use different types of finger move-ments and pressure on different acupoints, dependingon whether the chi needs to be increased or dispersed atdifferent points. The therapist observes and guides theenergy flow through the patient’s body throughout thesession. Sometimes, special herbs ( Artemesia vulgaris\\nor moxa) may be placed on a point to warm it, a processcalled moxibustion .

Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and con-sumers should be aware if their policies cover alternativetreatment, acupuncture, or massage therapy.\\nSelf-treatment\\nAcupressure is easy to learn, and there are many\\ngood books that illustrate the position of acupoints andmeridians on the body.

Finally, certain acu-\\npressure points should not be stimulated on people withhigh or low blood pressure and on pregnant women.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nIn general, Chinese medicine has been slow to gain\\nacceptance in the West, mainly because it rests on ideasvery foreign to the scientific model. For instance, West-ern scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi-ble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer-tain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some-times too simple for scientists to believe.\\nWestern scientists, in trying to account for the action\\nof acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part ofthe neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho-pedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominatedfor the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject calledCross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per-ils of Electropollution . By using precise electrical measur-\\ning devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that thebody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, andthat traditional acupressure meridians and points containedamounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not.The mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure\\nremain difficult to document in terms of the biochemicalprocesses involved; numerous testimonials are the prima-ry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressureand acupuncture.

The American Medical Association has beenresistant to researching it, as it is based on concepts verydifferent from the Western scientific model.\\nSeveral forms of acupuncture are being used today in\\nAmerica. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee-dles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac-tice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points onlyon the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balanceinternal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-ular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-rologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncturebased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditionalChinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.\\nBasic ideas of Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\\nthe universe, and subject to universal laws and principlesof harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does notdraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, betweenmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-tions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-ease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-tors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as\\nfundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols andideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-icine typically describes health in terms of measurablephysical processes made up of chemical reactions, theChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-tem, and the five elements to describe health and thebody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it isworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-rate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.For example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.In gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yinis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark andyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downwardand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is evercompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.These two principles are always interacting, opposing,and influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-cine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allowthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniouslytogether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 41Acupuncture\\nConception vessel\\nStomach meridian\\nLarge intestine meridian\\nGallbladder meridianGovernor vessel\\nBladder meridian\\nTriple burner meridian\\nSmall intestine meridian\\nAcupuncture sites and meridians on the face and neck.

Thus, acupuncturetherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, orincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-\\nicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-ble and is found in the environment in the air, water, foodand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital forcethat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-ited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi fromthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level andquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state ofphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travelsthrough the body along channels called meridians .\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-ach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-ney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triplewarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Eachorgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organinteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. Asthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chiwhich can move through the body, and these movethrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinesedoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptomsare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or moreorgans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from oneKEY TERMS\\nAcupressure —Form of massage using acupunc-\\nture points.\\nAuricular acupuncture —Acupuncture using only\\npoints found on the ears.\\nChi—Basic life energy.\\nMeridian —Channel through which chi travels in\\nthe body.\\nMoxibustion —Acupuncture technique which\\nburns the herb moxa or mugwort.\\nTonification —Acupuncture technique for strength-\\nening the body.\\nYin/Yang —Universal characteristics used to des-\\ncribe aspects of the natural world.organ to another. Each organ has a different profile of\\nsymptoms it can manifest.\\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-\\nry is that the world and body are made up of five mainelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-ments are all interconnected, and each element eithergenerates or controls another element. For instance,water controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinesesystem uses elements and organs to describe and treatconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated withwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the twoorgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-ney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fireproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made byacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/orincrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical andmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-ple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Westernscientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.For instance, Western medicine has observed that withsevere heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but itstill does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,this connection between the two organs has long beenestablished.\\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-\\nnese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy ortreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innateharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors likeemotions, external factors like the environment andweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, andgerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily aproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in theenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,as each body has its own characteristics of symptoms andbalance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flowof chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-en the body and prompt it to heal itself.\\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an\\nacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’smedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-tional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-view. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient tofind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, thepulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-eral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. Fromthis, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns ofsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 42AcupunctureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 42', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 36}), Document(page_content='imbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-\\nist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or moreof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-ans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used inacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-quently used by traditional acupuncturists. During anindividual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,depending on which meridian points are chosen.\\nAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-tion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels arebeing treated. Some points barely go beyond superficiallayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require adepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-ly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinchingsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-riences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-turist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slightelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may\\nbe sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa ormugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncturepoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-ulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-times use cupping , during which small suction cups are\\nplaced on meridian points to stimulate them.\\nHow long the needles are inserted also varies. Some\\npatients only require a quick in and out insertion to clearproblems and provide tonification (strengthening of\\nhealth), while some other conditions might require nee-dles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit toan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The numberof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with someconditions improved in one or two sessions and othersrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course ofweeks or months.\\nCosts for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether\\nthe practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MDacupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-its usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement alsovaries widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-lations have been changing often. Some states authorizeMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, andsome states have mandated that general coverage pay foracupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisionsfor acupuncture in their individual policies.\\nPrecautions\\nAcupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a\\npatient is in doubt about a medical condition, more thanone physician should be consulted. Also, a patient shouldalways feel comfortable and confident that theiracupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.Research and general acceptance\\nMainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc-\\nture; although more MDs are using it, the American MedicalAssociation does not recognize it as a specialty. The reasonfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult toscientifically understand or measure, such as the invisibleenergy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting thatacupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that theenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system andthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, ornatural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi-guity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues toshow effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain toalleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and researchin acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-tive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currentlyfunding research in the use of acupuncture for treatingdepression and attention-deficit disorder.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFleischman, Dr. Gary F.

Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func-tioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin toaccumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in thebloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure maybecome puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands,and feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, andthey may experience fatigue and nausea.\\nUnlike chronic kidney failure , which is long term\\nand irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con-dition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typicallybe reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to thekidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently asa complication of serious illness, like heart failure ,l i v e r\\nfailure, dehydration , severe burns , and excessive bleed-\\ning (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc-tion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis-ease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-\\nent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditionsfall into three main categories: prerenal ,postrenal , and\\nintrarenal conditions.\\nPrerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, but\\ncan cause diminished kidney function. They are the mostcommon cause of acute renal failure, and include:\\n• dehydration\\n• hemorrhage• septicemia, or sepsis\\n• heart failure\\n• liver failure• burns\\nPostrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct-\\ning the urinary tract. These conditions include:\\n• inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis)\\n• enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic\\nhypertrophy)\\n• bladder or pelvic tumors\\n•kidney stones (calculi)Intrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or\\ndirect injury to the kidneys. These conditions include:\\n• lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)\\n• use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney\\nproblems\\n• drug abuse or overdose• long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain\\npain medicines\\n• acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the\\nkidney ( glomerulonephritis )\\n• kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis)\\nCommon symptoms of acute kidney failure include:\\n• anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery-\\nthropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red bloodcell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking ofthe kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead-ing to anemia.\\n• bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva may\\ncause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.\\n• bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\\nD, which helps the body absorb calcium and keepsbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bonesmay become brittle. In children, normal growth may bestunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of highphosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acidmay cause gout .\\n• edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,\\nand around the eyes.\\n• frequent urination.\\n• foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause it\\nto foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicatebleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,or ureters.\\n• headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.\\n• hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\\nfluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. Thismakes blood pressure rise.\\n• increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the\\npresence of anemia may cause the patient to feelexhausted.\\n• itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine,\\naccumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure.An increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch.\\n• lower back pain. Patients suffering from certain kidney\\nproblems (like kidney stones and other obstructions)may have pain where the kidneys are located, in thesmall of the back below the ribs.\\n• nausea.

A nephrolo-\\ngist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con-sulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat-ment options. The patient that is suspected of havingacute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests todetermine the level of kidney function. A blood test willassess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium.The kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urinesamples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hourperiod, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance.\\nDetermining the cause of kidney failure is critical to\\nproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces-sary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and ifthe kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays, magnetic res-\\nonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scan (CT),\\nultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneysmay be used to determine the cause of kidney failure andlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasoundof the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatment\\nis directed to the underlying, primary medical conditionthat has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions maybe treated with replacement fluids given through a vein,diuretics , blood transfusion , or medications. Postrenal\\nconditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgeryand/or medication.\\nFrequently, patients in acute kidney failure require\\nhemodialysis ,hemofiltration , or peritoneal dialysis to fil-\\nter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri-mary medical condition can be controlled.\\nHemodialysis\\nHemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s\\nblood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir-cuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up ofplastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti-ficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors andmaintains blood flow and administers dialysate.Dialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used todraw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s bloodleaves the body through the vein and travels through theECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place.\\nDuring dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream\\nare carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytesand other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified,chemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body.KEY TERMS\\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) —A waste product that\\nis formed in the liver and collects in the blood-stream; patients with kidney failure have highBUN levels.\\nCreatinine —A protein produced by muscle that\\nhealthy kidneys filter out.\\nExtracorporeal —Outside of, or unrelated to, the\\nbody.\\nIschemia —A lack of blood supply to an organ or\\ntissue.\\nNephrotoxic —Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.\\nRadiocontrast agents —Dyes administered to a\\npatient for the purposes of a radiologic study.\\nSepsis —A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.\\nVasopressors —Medications that constrict the blood\\nvessels.\\nA dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours,\\ndepending on the type of dialyzer used and the physicalcondition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times aweek until acute kidney failure is reversed.\\nBlood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-\\nsis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option inthese cases.\\nHemofiltration\\nHemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace-\\nment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra-tion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti-cally ill patients. These patients are typically very sickand may have heart problems or circulatory problems.They cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial-ysis. They also frequently need antibiotics ,nutrition ,\\nvasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein totreat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration iscontinuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients inkidney failure without the risk of fluid overload.\\nLike hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. A\\nhollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer toremove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, ablood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. Thevolume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil-tration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration ratesare slower and gentler on the circulatory system.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 45Acute kidney failureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 45', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 39}), Document(page_content='Hemofiltration treatment will generally be used until kid-\\nney failure is reversed.\\nPeritoneal dialysis\\nPeritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidney\\nfailure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis. Inperitoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’sabdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter. A flexibletube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically inserted intothe patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter isused to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Wasteproducts and excess fluids move from the patient’s blood-stream into the dialysate solution. After a certain timeperiod, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from theabdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate. There arethree type of peritoneal dialysis, which vary according totreatment time and administration method.\\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment option\\nfor infants and children. Their small size can make veinaccess difficult to maintain. It is not recommended forpatients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominaldefects (like a hernia ) that might reduce the efficiency of\\nthe treatment. It is also not recommended for patientswho suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of thesmall pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).\\nPrognosis\\nBecause many of the illnesses and underlying con-\\nditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical,the prognosis for these patients many times is not good.Studies have estimated overall death rates for acute kid-\\nney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, diebecause of the primary disease that has caused the kid-ney failure. These figures may also be misleadingbecause patients who experience kidney failure as aresult of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones ordehydration) have an excellent chance of completerecovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriatetreatment are key to patient recovery.\\nUp to 10% of patients who experience acute kidney\\nfailure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They willeventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure orend-stage renal disease. These patients will require long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace their\\nlost renal functioning.\\nPrevention\\nSince acute kidney failure can be caused by many\\nthings, prevention is difficult. Medications that mayimpair kidney function should be given cautiously.Patients with pre-existing kidney conditions who arehospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care-\\nfully monitored for kidney failure complications. Treat-ments and procedures that may put them at risk for kid-ney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrastagents or dyes) should be used with extreme caution.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBock, G.

The infected lymphatic vesselbecomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visiblebelow the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occursso rapidly that the immune system does not respond fastenough to stop the infection.\\nIf left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue\\ndestruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,painful lump called an abscess may be formed in the\\ninfected area. Cellulitis , a generalized infection of the\\nlower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte-ria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia.Lay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seenin the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri-ous illness and may be fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac-\\nterium Streptococcus pyogenes . This potentially danger-\\nous bacterium also causes strep throat , infections of the\\nheart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has beencalled the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte-ria may also cause lymphangitis.\\nAlthough anyone can develop lymphangitis, some\\npeople are more at risk. People who have had radical mas-\\ntectomy (removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), a\\nleg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrentlymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection onthe foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis\\nare the wide, red streaks which travel from the site ofinfection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red,swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin mayoccur. The bacterial infection causes a fever of 100-104°F\\n(38°–40°C). In addition, a general ill feeling, muscleaches, headache , chills, and loss of appetite may be felt.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf lymphangitis is suspected, the person should call\\nhis or her doctor immediately or go to an emergencyroom. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by thefamily doctor, infectious disease specialist, or an emer-gency room doctor.

The only treatment foracute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of anantibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growingstreptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly andeasily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may beincluded in the treatment to kill any streptococci whichare not growing and are in a resting state. Alternatively, a“broad spectrum” antibiotic may be used which wouldkill many different kinds of bacteria.\\nAspirin or other medications which reduce the pain\\nand the fever may also be given.

Symp-toms of APSGN include:\\n• fluid accumulation and tissue swelling ( edema ) initial-\\nly in the face and around the eyes, later in the legs\\n• low urine output (oliguria)• blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\\n• high blood pressure• joint pain or stiffnessDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’s\\nhistory, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer-tain laboratory tests. Urinalysis usually shows blood and\\nprotein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati-nine (two waste products normally filtered out of theblood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi-cating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensiveblood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirmthat a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. Athroat culture may also show the presence of group A\\nbeta-hemolytic streptococci.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the\\nsymptoms and prevent complications. Some patients areadvised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrictfluid and salt intake. Antibiotics may be prescribed to\\nkill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presenceis confirmed. Antihypertensives may be given to helpcontrol high blood pressure and diuretics may be used to\\nreduce fluid retention and swelling. Kidney dialysis is\\nrarely needed.\\nPrognosis\\nMost children (up to 95%) fully recover from\\nAPSGN in a matter of weeks or months. Most adults (upto 70%) also recover fully. In those who do not recoverfully, chronic or progressive problems of kidney functionmay occur. Kidney failure may result in some patients.\\nPrevention\\nReceiving prompt treatment for streptococcal infec-\\ntions may prevent APSGN.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

(Dissociation is a psychological reaction to traumain which the mind tries to cope by “sealing off” somefeatures of the trauma from conscious awareness).\\nDescription\\nAcute stress disorder is a new diagnostic category\\nthat was introduced in 1994 to differentiate time-limitedreactions to trauma from post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute stress disorder is caused by exposure to trau-\\nma, which is defined as a stressor that causes intense fearand, usually, involves threats to life or serious injury tooneself or others. Examples are rape, mugging, combat,natural disasters, etc.\\nThe symptoms of stress disorder include a combining\\nof one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms withthe avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event. Disso-ciative symptoms include emotional detachment, tempo-rary loss of memory, depersonalization, and derealization.\\nAnxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor-\\nder include irritability, physical restlessness, sleep prob-lems, inability to concentrate, and being easily startled.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a com-\\nbination of the patient’s history and a physical examina-\\ntion to rule out diseases that can cause anxiety. TheKEY TERMS\\nDepersonalization —A dissociative symptom in\\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unre-al, is changing, or is dissolving.\\nDerealization —A dissociative symptom in which\\nthe external environment is perceived as unreal.\\nDissociation —A reaction to trauma in which the\\nmind splits off certain aspects of the trauma fromconscious awareness. Dissociation can affect thepatient’s memory, sense of reality, and sense ofidentity.\\nTrauma —In the context of ASD, a disastrous or\\nlife-threatening event.\\nessential feature is a traumatic event within one month of\\nthe onset of symptoms. Other diagnostic criteria include:\\n• The symptoms significantly interfere with normal\\nsocial or vocational functioning\\n• The symptoms last between two days and four weeks.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute stress disorder usually includes\\na combination of antidepressant medications and short-term psychotherapy.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAcupuncture has been recommended as a treatment\\nfor acute stress disorder. Some other alternativeapproaches, including meditation , breathing exercises,\\nand yoga , may be helpful when combined with short-\\nterm psychotherapy. Homeopathic treatment and the useof herbal medicine and flower essences also can help theperson with acute stress disorder rebalance on the physi-cal, mental, and emotional levels.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery is influenced by the sever-\\nity and duration of the trauma, the patient’s closeness to it,and the patient’s previous level of functioning. Favorablesigns include a short time period between the trauma andonset of symptoms, immediate treatment, and appropriatesocial support.

The term hasbeen partially replaced by the word dependence for sub-\\nstance abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, toinclude mood-altering behaviors or activities. Someresearchers speak of two types of addictions: substanceaddictions (for example, alcoholism , drug abuse, and\\nsmoking ); and process addictions (for example, gam-\\nbling, spending, shopping, eating, and sexual activity).There is a growing recognition that many addicts, such aspolydrug abusers, are addicted to more than one sub-stance or process.\\nDescription\\nAddiction is one of the most costly public health\\nproblems in the United States. It is a progressive syn-drome, which means that it increases in severity overtime unless it is treated. Substance abuse is characterizedby frequent relapse, or return to the abused substance.Substance abusers often make repeated attempts to quitbefore they are successful.\\nIn 1995 the economic cost of substance abuse in the\\nUnited States exceeded $414 billion, with health carecosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at morethan $114 billion.\\nBy eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed\\nalcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% havesmoked marijuana. Compared to females, males arealmost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearlyone and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more ofcigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuanaweekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif-ferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac-co,cocaine and heavy drinking appears to have remained\\nstable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased.\\nIn 1999, an estimated four million Americans over the\\nage of 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and\\nstimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month.\\nIn the United States, 25% of the population regularly\\nuses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times asmany people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com-bined. According to 1998 data from the World HealthOrganization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwideand 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore,in the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years areexposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which hasbeen implicated in sudden infant death syndrome ,l o w\\nbirth weight, asthma , middle ear disease, pneumonia ,\\ncough , and upper respiratory infection.\\nEating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa ,bulim-\\nia nervosa , and binge eating, affect over five million\\nAmerican women and men. Fifteen percent of youngwomen have substantially disordered attitudes towardeating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women dieeach year from anorexia nervosa.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 50AddictionGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 50', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 44}), Document(page_content='A 1997 Harvard study found that an estimated 15.4\\nmillion Americans suffered from a gambling addiction.Over half that number (7.9 million) were adolescents.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAddiction to substances results from the interaction\\nof several factors:\\nDrug chemistry\\nSome substances are more addictive than others,\\neither because they produce a rapid and intense change inmood; or because they produce painful withdrawalsymptoms when stopped suddenly.\\nGenetic factor\\nSome people appear to be more vulnerable to addic-\\ntion because their body chemistry increases their sensi-tivity to drugs. Some forms of substance abuse and\\ndependence seem to run in families; and this may be the\\nresult of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ-ences, or a combination of both.\\nBrain structure and function\\nUsing drugs repeatedly over time changes brain\\nstructure and function in fundamental and long-lastingways. Addiction comes about through an array ofchanges in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-ry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lastingbrain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-nitive and emotional functioning that characterizeaddicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.Although the causes of addiction remain the subject ofongoing debate and research, many experts now consideraddiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused bypersistent changes in brain structure and function. How-ever, having this brain disease does not absolve theaddict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it doesexplain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs bysheer force of will alone.\\nSocial learning\\nSocial learning is considered the most important sin-\\ngle factor. It includes patterns of use in the addict’s fami-ly or subculture, peer pressure, and advertising or mediainfluence.\\nAvailability\\nInexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol, or\\ndrugs produce marked increases in rates of addiction.Individual development\\nBefore the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality\\nwas used to explain the development of addiction. Theaddictive personality was described as escapist, impul-sive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen-tered. Many doctors now believe that these charactertraits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction,rather than the traits being a cause of the addiction.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn addition to a preoccupation with using and\\nacquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic-tion is based on five criteria:\\n• loss of willpower\\n• harmful consequences\\n• unmanageable lifestyle• tolerance or escalation of use• withdrawal symptoms upon quitting\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 51Addiction\\nCrack users.

Substance addicts may need hospital treat-ment to manage withdrawal symptoms. Individual orgroup psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after sub-stance use has stopped. Anti-addiction medications, suchas methadone and naltrexone, are also commonly used.\\nThe most frequently recommended social form of\\noutpatient treatment is the twelve-step program. Suchprograms are also frequently combined with psychother-apy. According to a recent study reported by the Ameri-can Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardlessof his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs,can benefit from participation in 12-step programs suchas Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anony-mous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-helpgroups exceeds the number of visits to all mental healthprofessionals combined. There are twelve-step groupsfor all major substance and process addictions.\\nThe Twelve Steps are:\\n• Admit powerlessness over the addiction.• Believe that a Power greater than oneself could restore\\nsanity.\\n• Make a decision to turn your will and your life over to\\nthe care of God, as you understand him.\\n• Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of self.\\n• Admit to God, yourself, and another human being the\\nexact nature of your wrongs.\\n• Become willing to have God remove all these defects\\nfrom your character.\\n• Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings.• Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs and\\nbecome willing to make amends to them all.\\n• Make direct amends to such people, whenever possible\\nexcept when to do so would injure them or others.\\n• Continue to take personal inventory and promptly\\nadmit any future wrongdoings.\\n• Seek to improve contact with a God of the individual’s\\nunderstanding through meditation and prayer.\\n• Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others and\\npractice these principles in all your affairs.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAcupuncture and homeopathy have been used to\\ntreat withdrawal symptoms. Meditation, yoga , and reiki\\nhealing have been recommended for process addictions,however, the success of these programs has not been welldocumented through controlled studies.Prognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery from any addiction\\ndepends on the substance or process, the individual’s cir-cumstances, and underlying personality structure.

This results in decreased production of twoimportant chemicals (hormones) normally released bythe adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the glandis known as the cortex; the inner part is known as themedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland isresponsible for producing different types of hormones.\\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioningof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout thebody, and is considered to be one of the few hormonesabsolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:\\n• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-\\nents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\\n• the normal functioning of the circulatory system and\\nthe heartKEY TERMS\\nGland —A collection of cells whose function is to\\nrelease certain chemicals, or hormones, which areimportant to the functioning of other, sometimesdistantly located, organs or body systems.\\nHormone —A chemical produced in one part of\\nthe body, which travels to another part of the bodyin order to exert its effect.\\n• the functioning of muscles\\n• normal kidney function\\n• production of blood cells• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-\\ntal system\\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n• the normal responses of the immune system\\nAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,\\nplays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-portions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-ance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughoutthe body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by adrop in blood pressure.\\nAddison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-\\ncal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferesdirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produceits hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosteronedrop, and numerous functions throughout the body aredisrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is the\\ndestruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenalcortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy isbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In anautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,responsible for identifying foreign invaders such asviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally beginsto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, anddestroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction ofthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis . The\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused byfungal infections, such as histoplasmosis , coccidiomy-\\ncosis, and cryptococcosis , which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 53Addison’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 47}), Document(page_content='called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis ,i n\\nwhich a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited inabnormal places throughout the body, interfering withthe function of whatever structure it is present within; orinvasion of the adrenal glands by cancer .\\nIn about 75% of all patients, Addison’s disease\\ntends to be a very gradual, slowly developing disease.Significant symptoms are not noted until about 90% ofthe adrenal cortex has been destroyed. The most com-mon symptoms include fatigue and loss of energy,\\ndecreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ,\\nabdominal pain , weight loss, muscle weakness, dizzi-\\nness when standing, dehydration , unusual areas of\\ndarkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As thedisease progresses, the patient may appear to have verytanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining ofthe mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentationof the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydrationbecomes more severe, the blood pressure will continueto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak andlight-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-toms, including depression and irritability. Women losepubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-strual periods.\\nWhen a patient becomes ill with an infection, or\\nstressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly andrapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptomsof this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heartrhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-trollable nausea and vomiting , a drastic drop in blood\\npressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified dueto the development of Addisonian crisis.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany patients do not recognize the slow progres-\\nsion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identifiedwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-tation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of bloodtests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It isnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,patients are given a testing dose of another hormonecalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in thebody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulatingthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-ease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increasecortisol levels.\\nTo distinguish between primary adrenocortical\\ninsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondaryadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of thepituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in\\nthe blood are examined. Normal or high levels ofACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,but the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to thepresence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis ofAddison’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing\\nthe missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potentform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in avein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss willalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-tions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressuremay require special medications to safely elevate it untilthe steroids take effect.\\nPatients with Addison’s disease will need to take a\\nsteroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacementfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest oftheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causesnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold downtheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medicalfacility where IV medications can be administered.When a patient has any kind of infection or injury, thenormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for patients appropriately treated with\\nhydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. Thesepatients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Withouttreatment, or with substandard treatment, patients arealways at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nWilliams, Gordon H., and Robert G.

The tonsilsbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-noids lie just above them and are hidden from view by thepalate. Together these four arsenals of immune defenseguard the major entrance to the body from foreigninvaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to therest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches itsgreatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. Inthis way children are best able to develop the immunitiesthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.\\nBeyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue\\ngrows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-tion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fightoff the invaders. Often it does not completely return to itsformer size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind alarger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make mattersworse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophiedglands can produce safe havens for germs where thebody cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi-\\notics and the reduction in infectious childhood diseases\\nover the past few generations, tonsils and adenoidscaused greater health problems.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply\\ncaused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis-sue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throatinfections by cold viruses, strep throat , mononucleosis,\\nand in times gone by, diphtheria . The acute infections\\nare usually referred to as tonsillitis , the adenoids getting\\nlittle recognition because they cannot be seen withoutspecial instruments. Symptoms include painful, brightred, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes(glands) beneath the jaw, fever , and general discomfort.\\nAfter the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-\\nerated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely largetonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although thatis quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathingand require a child to breathe through the mouth. Becausethey encircle the only connection between the middle earand the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can alsoobstruct it and cause middle ear infections.KEY TERMS\\nEustacian tube —A tube connecting the middle ear\\nwith the back of the nose, allowing air pressure toequalize within the ear whenever it opens, such aswith yawning.\\nHyperplastic —Overgrown.\\nHypertrophy —Overgrowth.\\nStrep throat —An infection of the throat caused by\\nbacteria of the Streptococcus family, which causes\\ntonsillitis.\\nUlcerated —Damaged so that the surface tissue is\\nlost and/or necrotic (dead).\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allows\\nan adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils mayhave deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue(necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir-ror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle earinfections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul-\\nture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi-\\nty of the germ.\\nTreatment\\nIt used to be standard practice to remove tonsils\\nand/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or earinfection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade-\\nnoidectomy (T and A). Opinion changed as it was realized\\nthat this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni-ty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro-duce only half the immunity to oral polio vaccine. In addi-\\ntion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibioticsand of recurring ear infections with surgical drainagethrough the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reducedthe incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are many botanical/herbal remedies that can\\nbe used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsilsand adenoids in their immune function at the opening ofthe oral cavity and to tone these glands. Keeping theEustachian tubes open is an important contribution tooptimal function in the tonsils and adenoids.

About 47 dif-\\nferent types have been identified since then, and abouthalf of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infantsand children are most commonly affected by adenovirus-es. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year,but seem to be most common from fall to spring.\\nAdenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res-\\npiratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill-nesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to causeinfection among military recruits and other young peoplewho live in institutional environments. Outbreaks amongchildren are frequently reported at boarding schools andsummer camps.\\nAcquired immunity\\nMost children have been infected by at least one\\nadenovirus by the time they reach school age. Mostadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirustypes due to infections they had as children.\\nIn one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic\\ninfection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade-noviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil-lion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec-tious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. Inchronic or latent infection, a much smaller number ofviruses are released and healthy cells can multiply morerapidly than they are destroyed. People who have thiskind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probablywhy many adults have immunity to adenoviruses withoutrealizing they have been infected.\\nChildhood infections\\nIn children, adenoviruses most often cause acute\\nupper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose.\\nAdenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible formost of these infections. Occasionally more seriouslower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia , may\\noccur.\\nAdenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival\\nfever in children. This disease is most often caused bytypes 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly andusually disappear in less than a week, include:\\n• inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)\\n•f e v e r\\n•sore throat (pharyngitis)\\n• runny nose\\n• inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervical\\nadenitis)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 56Adenovirus infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 56', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 50}), Document(page_content='Adenoviruses also cause acute diarrhea in young\\nchildren, characterized by fever and watery stools.

Achild who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine forabout three days, and invisible traces of blood can befound in the urine a few days longer. The child will feelthe urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to doso—for about the same length of time.\\nAdult infections\\nIn adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus\\ninfection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused bytypes 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp-toms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough\\nare almost always present; weakness, chills, headache ,\\nand swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur.The symptoms typically last three to five days.\\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade-\\nnovirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyardworkers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips ofrust or paint. This inflammation of tissues lining the eye-lid and covering the front of the eyeball can also becaused by using contaminated contact lens solutions orby drying the hands or face with a towel used by some-one who has this infection.\\nThe inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of con-\\njunctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and lastbetween one and four weeks. Only 5-8% of patients withepidemic keratoconjunctivitis experience respiratorysymptoms. One or both eyes may be affected. As symp-toms of conjunctivitis subside, eye pain and watering\\nand blurred vision develop. These symptoms of keratitis\\nmay last for several months, and about 10% of theseinfections spread to at least one other member of thepatient’s household.\\nOther illnesses associated with adenovirus include:\\n• encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and other\\ninfections of the central nervous system (CNS)\\n• gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intes-\\ntines)\\n• acute mesenteric lymphadenitis (inflammation of\\nlymph glands in the abdomen)\\n• chronic interstitial fibrosis (abnormal growth of con-\\nnective tissue between cells)\\n• intussusception (a type of intestinal obstruction)KEY TERMS\\nConjunctivitis —Inflammation of the conjunctiva,\\nthe mucous membrane lining the inner surfaces ofthe eyelid and the front of the eyeball.\\nVirus —A small infectious agent consisting of a\\ncore of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surround-ed by a shell of protein.\\n• pneumonia that doesn’t respond to antibiotic therapy\\n•whooping cough syndrome when Bordetella pertussis\\n(the bacterium that causes classic whooping cough) isnot found\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSpecific adenovirus infections can be traced to par-\\nticular sources and produce distinctive symptoms.

It is not the same thing as post-traumatic\\nstress disorder (PTSD), which usually occurs in reac-\\ntion to a life-threatening event and can be longer lasting.Description\\nAn adjustment disorder usually begins within three\\nmonths of a stressful event, and ends within six monthsafter the stressor stops. There are many different sub-types of adjustment disorders, including adjustment dis-order with:\\n• depression•anxiety\\n• mixed anxiety and depression• conduct disturbances• mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct• unspecified\\nAdjustment disorders are very common and can\\naffect anyone, regardless of gender, age, race, or lifestyle.By definition, an adjustment disorder is short-lived,unless a person is faced with a chronic recurring crisis(such as a child who is repeatedly abused). In such cases,the adjustment disorder may last more than six months.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAn adjustment disorder occurs when a person can’t\\ncope with a stressful event and develops emotional orbehavioral symptoms. The stressful event can be anything:it might be just one isolated incident, or a string of prob-lems that wears the person down. The stress might be any-\\nthing from a car accident or illness, to a divorce, or even acertain time of year (such as Christmas or summer).\\nPeople with adjustment disorder may have a wide\\nvariety of symptoms. How those symptoms combinedepend on the particular subtype of adjustment disorderand on the individual’s personality and psychologicaldefenses.

Normal expres-sion of grief, in bereavement for instance, is not consid-ered an adjustment disorder.\\nTreatment\\nPsychotherapy (counseling) is the treatment of\\nchoice for adjustment disorders, since the symptoms arean understandable reaction to a specific stress. The typeof therapy depends on the mental health expert, but itusually is short-term treatment that focuses on resolvingthe immediate problem.\\nTherapy usually will help clients:\\n• develop coping skills\\n• understand how the stressor has affected their lives\\n• develop alternate social or recreational activities\\nFamily or couples therapy may be helpful in some\\ncases. Medications are not usually used to treat adjust-ment disorders, although sometimes a few days or weeksof an anti-anxiety drug can control anxiety or sleepingproblems.\\nSelf-help groups aimed at a specific problem (such\\nas recovering from divorce or job loss) can be extremelyhelpful to people suffering from an adjustment disorder.Social support, which is usually an important part of self-help groups, can lead to a quicker recovery.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people recover completely from adjustment\\ndisorders, especially if they had no previous history ofmental problems, and have a stable home life with strongsocial support.

The\\nadrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine glandwith two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. Themain hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and themain hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.When tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they secreteexcess amounts of these hormones. A cancer that arises\\nin the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcino-ma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain,excess body hair, weakening of the bones and diabetes. Acancer in the adrenal medulla is called a pheochromocy-\\ntoma and can cause high blood pressure, headache ,pal-\\npitations , and excessive perspiration. Although these can-\\ncers can happen at any age, most occur in young adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIt is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,\\nbut some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 59Adrenal gland cancerGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 59', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 53}), Document(page_content='Symptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specific\\nhormones produced by that tumor.

The symptoms for pheochromocytoma includehypertension , acidosis, unexplained fever and weight\\nloss. Because of the hormones produced by this type oftumor, anxiety is often a feature also.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins with\\nblood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hor-mones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone. Italso includes magnetic resonance imaging , and com-\\nputed tomography scans to determine the extent of the\\ndisease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect thehigh levels of hormone secreted by the tumor.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is aimed at removing the tumor by\\nsurgery. In some cases, this can be done by laparoscopy .\\nSurgery is sometimes followed by chemotherapy and/or\\nradiation therapy . Because the surgery removes the\\nsource of many important hormones, hormones must besupplemented following surgery.

The adrenal glands produce many hormones\\nthat regulate body functions. These hormones includeandrogens, or male hormones. Androgens are producedin normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or both ofthe adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, pro-ducing more than the usual amount of androgens. Theexcess androgens create masculine characteristics.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually\\nthe result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present atbirth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia .\\nThe cause is usually a genetic problem that leads tosevere enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal viril-ism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The tumor canbe benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous (adrenal car-cinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a type oftumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).\\nNewborn girls with adrenal virilism have external\\nsex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and femaleorgans (called female pseudohermaphrodism). Newbornboys with the disorder have enlarged external sex organs,and these organs develop at an abnormally rapid pace.\\nChildren with congenital adrenal hyperplasia begin\\ngrowing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlierthan normal. Later in childhood, they are typically short-er than normal but have well-developed trunks.\\nWomen with adrenal virilization may develop facial\\nhair. Typically, their menstrual cycles are infrequent orabsent. They may also develop a deeper voice, a moreprominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs.\\nDiagnosis\\nEndocrinologists, doctors who specialize in the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have themost expertise to deal with adrenal virilization. SomeKEY TERMS\\nGlucocorticoid —A hormone produced by the\\nadrenal gland; this hormone leads to an increasein blood sugar and creation of sugar molecules bythe liver.\\nHydrocortisone —A hormone in the group of glu-\\ncocorticoid hormones.\\nPrednisone —A drug that functions as a glucocorti-\\ncoid hormone.doctors who treat disorders of the internal organs\\n(internists) and doctors who specialize in treating thereproductive system of women (gynecologists) may alsobe able to help patients with this disorder.\\nDiagnosis involves performing many laboratory\\ntests on blood samples from the patient. These tests mea-sure the concentration of different hormones. Differentabnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a differentpattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can alsohelp determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If atumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual-ize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend onobtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), andexamining it under a microscope in order to verify itscharacteristics.\\nTreatment\\nAdrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is\\ntreated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usuallyprednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor-tisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need-ed from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls withpseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make theirexternal sex organs appear more normal. If a tumor iscausing the disorder, the treatment will depend on thetype and location of the tumor. Information about thetumor cell type and the spread of the tumor is used todecide the best kind of treatment for a particular patient.If the tumor is cancerous, the patient will require specialtreatment depending on how far the cancer has\\nadvanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery,medications used to kill cancer cells ( chemotherapy ),\\nand x rays or other high energy rays used to kill cancercells ( radiation therapy ). Sometimes the doctor must\\nremove the adrenal gland and the surrounding tissues. Ifthe tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumormay be the best option.\\nPrognosis\\nOngoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controls\\nadrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia, but thereis no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused the disorder,patients have a better prognosis if they have an early stageof cancer that is diagnosed quickly and has not spread.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

Lampert\\nAdrenalectomy\\nDefinition\\nAdrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or\\nboth of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are pairedendocrine glands, one located above each kidney, thatproduce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena-lectomy is usually performed by conventional (open)surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may uselaparoscopy . With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can be\\naccomplished through four very small incisions.\\nPurpose\\nAdrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with\\ntumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors maybe malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessiveamounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce-dure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and mayalso remove cancerous tumors that can invade other partsof the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-mended when hormones produced by the adrenal glandsaggravate another condition such as breast cancer .\\nPrecautions\\nThe adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-\\nsels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleedingduring surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close toone of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava),and to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs toremove the gland(s) without damaging any of theseimportant and delicate organs.\\nDescription\\nOpen adrenalectomy\\nThe surgeon may operate from any of four direc-\\ntions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’sbody type.\\nIn the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal,just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operateon only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will rununder just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some-times a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomenprovides a better approach, especially if both adrenalglands are involved.\\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nback, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to beremoved, an incision is made on each side of the body.This approach is the most direct route to the adrenalglands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of thesurrounding structures as the anterior approach.\\nIn the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\npatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obesepatients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeonmust remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn thepatient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.\\nThe last approach involves an incision into the chest\\ncavity, either with or without part of the incision into theabdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipatesa very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine orremove nearby structures as well.\\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy\\nThis technique does not require the surgeon to open\\nthe body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2in diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, justunder the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur-geon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on atelevision monitor, is placed through one of the incisions.The other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturizedversions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to beoperated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out-side the body.\\nPreparation\\nMost aspects of preparation are the same as in other\\nmajor operations. In addition, hormone imbalances areoften a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicianswill try to correct hormone imbalances through medica-tion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumorsmay cause other problems such as hypertension or inad-\\nequate potassium in the blood, and these problems alsoshould be resolved if possible before surgery is per-formed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicinesfor days or weeks before surgery.\\nMost adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a\\nCT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ-ent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeonsmay order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing ofthe location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to helplocate exactly where the tumor is.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 63AdrenalectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 63', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 57}), Document(page_content='The day before surgery, patients will probably have\\nan enema to clear the bowels.

Thehighest levels occur in the morning hours. Testing fornormal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s disease, mayrequire multiple samples. For sequential follow-up, ablood sample analyzed for ACTH should always bedrawn at the same time each day.\\nACTH can be directly measured by an analyzing\\nmethod (immunoassay) in many large laboratories. How-ever, smaller laboratories are usually not equipped to per-form this test and they may need to send the blood sam-ple to a larger laboratory. Because of this delay, resultsmay take several days to obtain.\\nDescription\\nACTH production is partly controlled by an area in\\nthe center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partlycontrolled by the level of cortisol in the blood. WhenACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increasesto suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. IfACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus producescorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate thepituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels rise inresponse to stress , emotions, injury, infection, burns ,\\nsurgery, and decreased blood pressure.\\nCushing’s syndrome\\nCushing’s syndrome is caused by an abnormally high\\nlevel of circulating hydrocortisone. The high level may bethe result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement ofboth adrenal glands due to a pituitary tumor. The highlevel of hydrocortisone may be the result of taking corti-costeroid drugs for a long time. Corticosteroid drugs arewidely used for inflammation in disorders like rheuma-\\ntoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma .\\nAddison’s disease\\nAddison’s disease is a rare disorder in which\\nsymptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocorti-sone and aldosterone. The most common cause of thisdisease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune sys-tem normally fights foreign invaders in the body likebacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the immune sys-tems attacks the body. In this case, the immune systemproduces antibodies that attack the adrenal glands.Addison’s disease generally progresses slowly, withsymptoms developing gradually over months or years.However, acute episodes, called Addisonian crises, arebrought on by infection, injury, or other stresses.

The patient must fast from midnight until the testthe next morning. This means that the patient cannot eator drink anything after midnight except water. The patientmust also avoid radioisotope scanning tests or recentlyadministered radioisotopes prior to the blood test.\\nRisks\\nThe risks associated with this test are minimal.

Approximately one in100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basicforms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. Thechildhood form of the disease is the classical form and isthe most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-ally leads to total disability or death . It affects only boys\\nbecause the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the Xchromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages fourand ten and can include many different symptoms, not allof which appear together. The most common symptomsare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-toms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorlyarticulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-lems with gait and coordination, fatigue , increased skin\\npigmentation, and progressive dementia .\\nThe adult-onset form of the disease, also called\\nadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, isusually associated with a normal life span, and usuallyappears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may includeprogressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of the lower\\nlimbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora-tion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of thedisease occasionally experience the same symptoms, aswell as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessivemuscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy , and urinary\\nproblems. The neonatal form affects both male andfemale infants and may produce mental retardation ,\\nfacial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poormuscle tone, enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction.Neonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the\\nability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These buildup in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts.The build-up of very long chain fatty acids interfereswith the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles-terol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves inthe white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cellsare unable to function properly.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a\\nbiochemical test, and a family history. The biochemicaltest detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acidsin samples from amniocentesis , chorionic villi, plasma,\\nred blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi-cate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carriedon the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating\\nthe symptoms and supporting the patient with physicaltherapy, psychological counseling, and special educationin some cases. There is no cure for this disease, and thereare no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve andbrain cells. Dietary measures consist of reducing theintake of foods high in fat, which are a source of verylong chain fatty acids. A mixture called Lorenzo’s Oilhas been shown to reduce the level of long chain fattyacids if used long term; however, the rate of myelin loss\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 66Adrenoleukodystrophy3GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 66', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 60}), Document(page_content='is unaffected.

Lohr, PhD\\nAdrenomyeloneuropathy seeAdrenoleuko-\\ndystrophy\\nAdult respiratory distress\\nsyndrome\\nDefinition\\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also\\ncalled acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type oflung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any dis-ease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in thelungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-drome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up oneof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-\\nure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose\\nlungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is atrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdownof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluidfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lunginto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacsat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).This is the all-important site where oxygen passes fromair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all partsof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages thispoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The resultis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS isone of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, theother being heart failure .\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left overfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-al derived from blood in the tissues. Typically thesematerials join together with large molecules in the blood(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-branes are very prominent in premature infants whodevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often calledhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe orlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather becomescarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of thelung to become narrower, and in time they, too, maybecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungsas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes muchharder for the patient to breathe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,\\nincluding some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:\\n• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when\\nregurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearlydrowning.\\n• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,\\nsuch as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-gen, which itself can injure the lungs.\\n• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis , a wide-\\nspread infection that gets into the blood.\\n• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the\\nbody.\\n• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in\\nitself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.\\n• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-\\ncular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vesselsthroughout the body, including the lungs.\\n• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-\\neling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-sels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.\\n• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,\\naspirin .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 67Adult respiratory distress syndromeGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 67', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 61}), Document(page_content='• Inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ), when\\nblood proteins, called enzymes, pass to the lungs andinjure lung cells.\\n• Severe burn injury.\\n• Injury of the brain, or bleeding into the brain, from any\\ncause may be a factor in ARDS for reasons that are notclear. Convulsions also may cause some cases.\\nUsually ARDS develops within one to two days of the\\noriginal illness or injury. The person begins to take rapidbut shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’schest with a stethoscope may hear “crackling” or wheez-\\ningsounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the\\nskin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues tofill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great troublebreathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple test using a device applied to the ear will\\nshow whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, andthis can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from anartery. The chest x ray may be normal in the early stages,\\nbut, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does notbelong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heartof normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDSand not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin-guish between these two possibilities is to place a catheterKEY TERMS\\nAlveoli —The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath-\\ning tubes of the lung where oxygen normally istaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.\\nAspiration —The process in which solid food, liq-\\nuids, or secretions that normally are swallowedare, instead, breathed into the lungs.\\nCapillaries —The smallest arteries which, in the\\nlung, are located next to the alveoli so that theycan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.\\nFace mask —The simplest way of delivering a high\\nlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or otherlow-oxygen conditions.\\nSteroids —A class of drugs resembling normal\\nbody substances that often help control inflamma-tion in the body tissues.\\nVentilator —A mechanical device that can take\\nover the work of breathing for a patient whoselungs are injured or are starting to heal.into a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.\\nIn this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillariescan be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar-ies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS.\\nTreatment\\nThe three main goals in treating patients with ARDS\\nare:\\n• To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS.\\nExamples are: to treat septic infection with the properantibiotics , and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if\\nARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen.\\n• To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to\\nleak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer-tain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones havebeen tried because they can combat inflammation, butthe actual results have been disappointing.\\n• To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the\\nlung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered bya face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on aventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through atube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in thewindpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatmentmust be closely supervised, and the pressure adjustedso that too much oxygen is not delivered.\\nPatients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten-\\nsive care unit, where experienced staff and all neededequipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided,by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration . Also, the\\npatient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again byvein, if oral intake is not sufficient.\\nPrognosis\\nIf the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to\\nheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs,such as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterialpneumonia will develop at some point. Without prompt\\ntreatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can beexpected to die. With modern treatment, however, abouthalf of all patients will survive. Those who do live usuallyrecover completely, with little or no long-term breathingdifficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on aventilator, but it may improve in the months after thepatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particularpatient will recover depends to a great extent on whetherthe primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in thefirst place can be effectively treated.\\nPrevention\\nThe only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis-\\neases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.

In the Western countries,the length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit ofthe life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. Duringthe latter half of life, an individual is more prone to haveproblems with the various functions of the body and todevelop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car-diovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductiveand urinary systems are particularly affected. The mostcommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,cancer , diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\\nDescription\\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and develop-\\nment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the normaltransition time after that flurry of activity. Although thereare quite a few age-related changes that tax the body, dis-ability is not necessarily a part of aging. Health andlifestyle factors together with the genetic makeup of theindividual, and determines the response to these changes.Body functions that are most often affected by age include:\\n• Hearing, which declines especially in relation to the\\nhighest pitched tones.\\n• The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase by\\nas much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of bodyfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulatesaround the stomach. The ability to excrete fats isimpaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases,including cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.\\n• The amount of water in the body decreases, which there-\\nfore decreases the absorption of water-soluble nutrients.Also, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.\\n• The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently,\\nthus affecting the elimination of wastes.\\n• A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease in\\nstomach acid production.\\n• A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with an\\naccompanying loss of mobility, agility, and flexibility.\\n• A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.\\n• A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.• Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,\\nleading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughoutthe body.\\n• Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that\\nnerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently, reflex-es are not as sharp, and memory and learning arediminished.\\n• A decrease in bone strength and density.\\n• Hormone levels, which gradually decline. The thyroid\\nand sexual hormones are particularly affected.\\n• Declining visual abilities. Age-related changes may\\nlead to diseases such as macular degeneration .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 69AgingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 69', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 63}), Document(page_content='• A compromised ability to produce vitamin D from sun-\\nlight.\\n• A reduction in protein formation leading to shrinkage\\nin muscle mass and decreased bone formation, possiblyleading to osteoporosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are several theories as to why the aging body\\nloses functioning. It may be that several factors worktogether or that one particular factor is at work more thanothers in a given individual.\\n• Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. The\\naging of the cells of each individual is programmed intothe genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju-venations in the life of a given cell. When cells die at arate faster than they are replaced, organs do not func-tion properly, and they are soon unable to maintain thefunctions necessary for life.\\n• Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed of\\ndestruction at the level of the chromosomes.\\n• Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes in\\nthe make-up of the connective tissue alter the stabilityof body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-tioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.\\n• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory of\\naging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemicalreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-ence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of thebody to break down. As time goes on, more cells die orlose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases tofunction as a whole.\\n• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune\\nsystem as it begins to wear out, and the body is moreprone to infections and tissue damage, which may finallycause death . Also, as the system breaks down, the body\\nis more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which thebody’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material andare destroyed or damaged by the immune system.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany problems can arise due to age-related changes\\nin the body. Although there is no one test to be given, athorough physical exam and a basic blood screening andblood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of fur-ther attention. When older people become ill, the firstsigns of disease are often nonspecific. Further examsshould be conducted if any of the following occur:\\n• diminished or lack of desire for food\\n• increasing confusion• failure to thrive\\n• urinary incontinence• dizziness• weight loss• falling\\nTreatment\\nFor the most part, doctors prescribe medications to\\ncontrol the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the Unit-ed States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over takemedications for various complaints. More women thanmen use these medications. The most common drugsused by the elderly are painkillers, diuretics or water\\npills, sedatives, cardiac drugs, antibiotics , and mental\\nhealth drugs.\\nEstrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly\\nprescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms ofaging. It is often used in conjunction with progesterone.ERT functions to help keep bones strong, reduce risk ofheart disease, restore vaginal lubrication, and to improveskin elasticity. Evidence suggests that it may also helpmaintain mental functions.\\nExpected results\\nAging is unavoidable, but major physical impair-\\nment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free lifewell through their later years. A well established supportsystem of family, friends, and health care providers,together with focus on good nutrition and lifestyle\\nhabits and good stress management, can prevent disease\\nand lessen the impact of chronic conditions.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNutritional supplements\\nConsumption of a high–quality multivitamin is rec-\\nommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connectedwith aging include B vitamins , vitamins A and C, folic\\nacid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, and\\ntrace minerals . Since stomach acids may be decreased, it\\nis suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin for-mula in gelatin capsules be used, as this form is the easi-est to digest. Such formulas may also contain enzymesfor further help with digestion.\\nAntioxidants can help to neutralize damage by the\\nfree radical actions thought to contribute to problems ofaging. They are also helpful in preventing and treatingcancer and in treating cataracts and glaucoma .

People with phobias feel dread or panic when they\\nface certain objects, situations, or activities. People withagoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, butpanic attacks, or panic disorder , are not a requirement\\nfor a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature ofagoraphobia is anxiety about being in places from which\\nescape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in whichhelp might be unavailable. The person suffering fromagoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa-tion and may become totally housebound.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAgoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, and\\nit is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans withintheir lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in womenas in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35.\\nThe symptoms of the panic attacks which may\\naccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, andmay include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a\\nfeeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters,fatigue , tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapid\\npulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom.\\nAgoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the\\nresult of a number of physical and environmental factors.For instance, they have been associated with biochemicalimbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit-ters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. Peoplewho have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop-ping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit-uation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories,irrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con-flicts. All of these factors may play a role to varyingextents in different cases of agoraphobia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 72AgoraphobiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 72', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 66}), Document(page_content='Diagnosis\\nPeople who suffer from panic attacks should discuss\\nthe problem with a physician. The doctor can diagnosethe underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make surethe symptoms aren’t related to some other underlyingmedical condition.\\nThe doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia\\nbased primarily on the patient’s description of his or hersymptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiencesanxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help isunavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone.While many people are somewhat apprehensive in thesesituations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’sactive avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or herability to work, socialize, or otherwise function.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both\\nmedication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients canbenefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty-line (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ,\\nsuch as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra-line (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panicattacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben-\\nzodiazepines , such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clon-\\nazepam (Klonipin).\\nThe mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and other\\nphobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A specific tech-nique that is often employed is called desensitization.The patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usu-ally triggers fear and avoidance, and, with the help ofbreathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope withthe situation. This helps break the mental connectionbetween the situation and the fear, anxiety, or panic.Patients may also benefit from psychodynamically ori-ented psychotherapy, discussing underlying emotionalconflicts with a therapist or support group.\\nPrognosis\\nWith proper medication and psychotherapy, 90% of\\npatients will find significant improvement in their symp-toms.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHallowell, Edward M.

It was first recognized in the United States\\nin 1981. AIDS is the advanced form of infection with theHIV virus, which may not cause recognizable disease for along period after the initial exposure (latency). No vaccineis currently available to prevent HIV infection. At present,all forms of AIDS therapy are focused on improving thequality and length of life for AIDS patients by slowing orhalting the replication of the virus and treating or prevent-ing infections and cancers that take advantage of a per-son’s weakened immune system.\\nDescription\\nAIDS is considered one of the most devastating public\\nhealth problems in recent history. In June 2000, the Centers\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 73AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 73', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 67}), Document(page_content='for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that\\n120,223 (includes only those cases in areas that have confi-dential HIV reporting) in the United States are HIV-posi-tive, and 311,701 are living with AIDS (includes only thosecases where vital status is known). Of these patients, 44%are gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenousdrug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate-ly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec-tion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide wereliving with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million beingnewly infected that year. Most of these cases are in thedeveloping countries of Asia and Africa.\\nRisk factors\\nAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk\\nfactors for HIV transmission vary according to category:\\n• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who\\ndo not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-mous, those who participate in anal intercourse, andthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms ofadvanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and\\nEurope, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-tion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas inAfrica, the disease is spread primarily through sexualintercourse among heterosexuals.\\n• Transmission in pregnancy . High-risk mothers include\\nwomen married to bisexual men or men who have anabnormal blood condition called hemophilia and\\nrequire blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, andwomen living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIVinfection among heterosexuals. The chances of trans-\\nmitting the disease to the child are higher in women inadvanced stages of the disease. Breast feeding increasesthe risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu-dine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decreasethe risk of transmission to the baby.\\n• Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.\\nWith the introduction of blood product screening in themid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in bloodtransfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans-fused. With respect to HIV transmission among drugabusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec-tions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number ofpersons who share a needle, and the number of AIDScases in the local population.\\n• Needle sticks among health care professionals. Present\\nstudies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee-dle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased ifthe injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica-tion, in combination with other medication.\\nHIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu-\\nal non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes.\\nAIDS in women\\nAIDS in women is a serious public health concern.\\nWomen exposed to HIV infection through heterosexualcontact are the most rapidly growing risk group in theUnited States population. The percentage of AIDS casesdiagnosed in women has risen from 7% in 1985 to 23% in1999. Women diagnosed with AIDS may not live as longas men, although the reasons for this finding are unclear.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 74AIDSRisk of acquiring HIV infection by entry site\\nEntry site Risk virus reaches entry site Risk virus enters Risk inoculated\\nConjuntiva Moderate Moderate Very low\\nOral mucosa Moderate Moderate LowNasal mucosa Low Low Very lowLower respiratory Very low Very low Very lowAnus Very high Very high Very highSkin, intact Very low Very low Very lowSkin, broken Low High High\\nSexual:\\nVagina Low High High\\nPenis Low Low HighUlcers (STD) Medium Low Very high\\nBlood:\\nProducts High High Low\\nShared needles High High HighAccidental needle High Very High LowTraumatic wound Modest High HighPerinatal High High HighGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 74', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 68}), Document(page_content='AIDS in children\\nSince AIDS can be transmitted from an infected moth-\\ner to the child during pregnancy, during the birth process, orthrough breast milk, all infants born to HIV-positive moth-ers are a high-risk group. As of 2000, it was estimated that87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41%of them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children bornto HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.\\nAIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in chil-\\ndren between one and four years of age. The intervalbetween exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS isshorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIVhave a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a yearand dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro-gresses more slowly; the average child patient survives toseven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS\\nis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organsystems. HIV attacks the body through three diseaseprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-\\nvous system dysfunction.\\nImmunodeficiency describes the condition in which\\nthe body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or isnot functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiencyresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein calledCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certainsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, thevirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptorcalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry ofthe virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-lar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showedthat defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop-ment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of theCCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor.\\nOnce HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra-\\ncellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com-pletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho-cytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 75AIDS\\nMature HIV-1 viruses (above) and the lymphocyte from which they emerged (below).Two immature viruses can be seen bud-\\nding on the surface of the lymphocyte (right of center).

Because the immune system\\ncells are destroyed, many different types of infectionsand cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakenedimmune system (opportunistic) can develop.\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against itsown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced inresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, proteinor particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-duces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-essary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Oncebound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal fromthe body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. SomeAIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-relatedthrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), in which the number\\nof blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels.\\nAs of 2000, researchers do not know precisely how\\nHIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can causedamage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theoryis that, once infected with HIV , one type of immune sys-tem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxinthat harms the nervous system.\\nThe course of AIDS generally progresses through\\nthree stages, although not all patients will follow thisprogression precisely:\\nAcute retroviral syndrome\\nAcute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe\\na group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosisand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70%of all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients arenot recognized as infected during this phase and may notseek medical attention. The symptoms may includefever ,fatigue , muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestive\\ndisturbances, weight loss, skin rashes ,headache , and\\nchronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).Approximately 25-33% of patients will experience aform of meningitis during this phase in which the mem-\\nbranes that cover the brain and spinal cord becomeinflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops betweenone and six weeks after infection and lasts for two tothree weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicatethe presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of theviral p24 antigen in the blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the diseasebecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more beforesymptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,the virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, whereit may cause one or more of the following conditions:PERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL).\\nPersistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con-dition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painlessswellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period.The lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGLare those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.PGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and generalweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of foodmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-lism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting orwasting syndrome.\\nOTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeastinfection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,or other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and other gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and\\nweight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; anddegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.HIV infection of the nervous system leads to general lossof strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness orburning sensations in the feet or lower legs.\\nLate-stage disease (AIDS)\\nAIDS is usually marked by a very low number of\\nCD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequencyof opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitorthe number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in thepatient’s blood in order to assess the progression of thedisease and the effectiveness of different medications.About 10% of infected individuals never progress to thisovert stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro-gressors.\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm3, he or\\nshe is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. Theinfectious organisms may include the following:\\n• Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated\\nwith AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).\\nPCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% ofAIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’sprognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeastinfection of the mouth ( candidiasis or thrush) and\\ncryptococcal meningitis.\\n• Protozoa. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic\\ninfection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-zoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasisand cryptosporidiosis.\\n• Mycobacteria. AIDS patients may develop tuberculo-\\nsisor MAC infections. MAC infections are caused by\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 76AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 76', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 70}), Document(page_content='Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare , and occur in\\nabout 40% of AIDS patients. It is rare until CD4+counts falls below 50 cells/mm\\n3.\\n• Bacteria. AIDS patients are likely to develop bacterial\\ninfections of the skin and digestive tract.\\n• Viruses. AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to\\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes pro-gressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain stem, cere-brum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoencephalopathyor PML), which is regarded as an AIDS-defining illnessby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nAIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC COM-\\nPLICATIONS. AIDS dementia complex is usually a late\\ncomplication of the disease. It is unclear whether it iscaused by the direct effects of the virus on the brain or byintermediate causes. AIDS dementia complex is marked\\nby loss of reasoning ability, loss of memory, inability toconcentrate, apathy and loss of initiative, and unsteadi-ness or weakness in walking. Some patients also developseizures. There are no specific treatments for AIDSdementia complex.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients in\\nlate-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the mus-cles, particularly in the hip area, and may have arthritis-like pains in the joints.\\nORAL SYMPTOMS. In addition to thrush and painful\\nulcers in the mouth, patients may develop a conditioncalled hairy leukoplakia of the tongue. This condition isalso regarded by the CDC as an indicator of AIDS. Hairyleukoplakia is a white area of diseased tissue on thetongue that may be flat or slightly raised.

The polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR) test can be used to detect the presence of viralnucleic acids in the very small number of HIV patientswho have false-negative results on the ELISA and West-ern blot tests. These tests are also used to detect virusesand bacterium other than HIV and AIDS.\\nOTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnos-\\ntic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used totrack the course of AIDS in patients that have alreadybeen diagnosed. These include blood counts, viral loadtests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of /H9252\\n2-\\nmicroglobulin ( /H92522M).\\nDoctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose the\\npresence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or other dis-ease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biopsies, samples ofcerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated imaging techniques,such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed\\ntomography scans (CT) are used to diagnose AIDS-related\\ncancers, some opportunistic infections, damage to the centralnervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and stoolsamples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasites.AIDS patients are also given blood tests for syphilis and\\nother sexually transmitted diseases.\\nDiagnosis in children\\nDiagnostic blood testing in children older than 18\\nmonths is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screeningconfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diag-nosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing,and p24 antigen testing.\\nIn terms of symptoms, children are less likely than\\nadults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, howev-er, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequentillness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count,failure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Childrenwith AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec-tions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related braindisorders than are HIV-positive adults.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for AIDS covers four considerations:\\nTREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND\\nMALIGNANCIES. Most AIDS patients require complex\\nlong-term treatment with medications for infectious dis-eases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel-opment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-related malignancies in the central nervous system areusually treated with radiation therapy . Cancers else-\\nwhere in the body are treated with chemotherapy .PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC\\nINFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is\\ngiven to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history ofPneumocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200\\ncells/mm\\n3or 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush\\nshould be given prophylactic medications. The threedrugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-sone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.\\nANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years\\nresearchers have developed drugs that suppress HIVreplication, as distinct from treating its effects on thebody. These drugs fall into three classes:\\n• Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interfering\\nwith the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect-ed cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. Thesedrugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi-dine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu-dine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC).\\n•Protease inhibitors . Protease inhibitors can be effective\\nagainst HIV strains that have developed resistance tonucleoside analogues, and are often used in combinationwith them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton-avir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir.\\n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is\\na new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available,nevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine andefavirin.\\nTreatment guidelines for these agents are in constant\\nchange as new medications are developed and intro-duced. Two principles currently guide doctors in workingout drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinationsof drugs rather than one medication alone; and basingtreatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viralload tests.\\nSTIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.\\nBecause many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal-ly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they maybe given medications to stimulate blood cell production.Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemicpatients. Patients with low white blood cell counts maybe given filgrastim or sargramostim.\\nTreatment in women\\nTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-\\nlarly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has beenshown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into\\ntwo categories: those intended to help the immune sys-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 80AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 80', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 74}), Document(page_content='tem and those aimed at pain control. Treatments that\\nmay enhance the function of the immune system includeChinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicine,macrobiotic and other special diets ,guided imagery and\\ncreative visualization, homeopathy , and vitamin therapy.\\nPain control therapies include hydrotherapy ,reiki ,\\nacupuncture ,meditation ,chiropractic treatments, and\\ntherapeutic massage. Alternative therapies can also beused to help with side effects of the medications used inthe treatment of AIDS.\\nPrognosis\\nAt the present time, there is no cure for AIDS.\\nTreatment stresses aggressive combination drug\\ntherapy for those patients with access to the expensivemedications and who tolerate them adequately. The useof these multi-drug therapies has significantly reducedthe numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting fromAIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potentialexists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using theseand other drug therapies to boost the immune system,keep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis-tic infections and malignancies.\\nPrognosis after the latency period depends on the\\npatient’s specific symptoms and the organ systemsaffected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-phomas of the central nervous system die within two tothree months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-phomas may survive for eight to ten months.\\nPrevention\\nAs of 2001, there is no vaccine effective against\\nAIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated,however, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as atherapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing tofull-blown AIDS.\\nIn the meantime, there are many things that can be\\ndone to prevent the spread of AIDS:\\n• Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individuals\\nmust be instructed in the proper use of condoms andurged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk ofHIV infection, condoms are successful in preventingother sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg-nancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship withsomeone, get tested for HIV infection.\\n• Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users.\\n• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-\\ntored, those individuals who are planning to undergomajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of timeto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion .• Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre-\\ncautions by wearing gloves and masks when handlingbody fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.\\n• If you suspect that you may have become infected, get\\ntested for HIV infection. If treated aggressively earlyon, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefi-nitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it is also vital tolet your sexual partners know so that they can be testedand, if necessary, receive medical attention.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEarly HIV Infection Guideline Panel.

Thesetests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serologyis the branch of immunology that deals with the contentsand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear lightyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cellsform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence ofhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in bloodserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.\\nPurpose\\nAIDS serology serves several different purposes.\\nSome AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used toscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.\\nIn order to understand the different purposes of the\\nblood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful tounderstand how HIV infection affects human blood andthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters theblood stream of a new host in the following ways:\\n• by sexual contact\\n• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and\\nurine)\\n• by transmission during pregnancy ,o r\\n• through transfusion of infected blood products\\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of whiteblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, andmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate andkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, theAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance calledinterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cellsand B cells) in the human immune system to respond toinfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce asthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and Bcells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.\\nPrecautions\\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. Aswith all blood tests, healthcare professionals shouldalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked bythe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, itmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenousdrug user due to collapsed veins.\\nDescription\\nDiagnostic tests\\nDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to\\npersons in high-risk populations who may have beenexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms ofAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop adetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibodyin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons whohave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.\\nIt is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating\\nthe virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstratingthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—ittakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. Morecommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination toscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.\\nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).\\nThis type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-fusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test forHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well orbeads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of asubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forminga color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer canmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived fromthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-ond antibody.\\nThe latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-\\nsitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-tive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-risk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-tive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of\\nthe patient’s blood . If the second ELISA is positive, the\\nresult should be confirmed by the Western blot test.\\nWESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot\\nor immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure toconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large proteinmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from oneanother by running an electric current through the gel).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 82AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 76}), Document(page_content='The HIV antigens are attached by blotting to a nylon or\\nnitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is reacted againstthe filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-cals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a coloredpatch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot testfor HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricatedstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s bloodserum and the developing chemicals. About nine differentHIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.\\nWhen used in combination with ELISA testing,\\nWestern blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,yield false negatives in patients with very early HIVinfection and in those infected by HIV-2. In somepatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.\\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method\\nis sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofWestern blotting. An IFA test detects the presence ofHIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix-ing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding theblood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro-scope with ultraviolet light.\\nPOLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is\\nused to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patientswith false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. Thesepatients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto-matic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do nothave any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectablequantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega-tive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for thevery low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted byblood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood.\\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea-\\nsure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’sblood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV .This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle-ic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene aremade by separating the two strands of DNA containingthe gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly-merase to make a copy, and then continuously replicatingthe copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replaceWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-noses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-sons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generatedan antibody response to the virus, the overwhelmingmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISAscreening within one to three months of infection. Inaddition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge ofthe genetic sequences in HIV . Since the virus is continual-ly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield afalse negative in patients with these new variants.In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit containsmultiple components, including material for specimen col-lection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo-ratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun-seling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection.The results are obtained by the purchaser through a tollfree telephone number using a personal identificationnumber (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over thetelephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approvedby the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system.\\nPrognostic tests\\nBlood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed\\nwith HIV infection are as important as the diagnostictests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per-sons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longerbefore they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patientsare sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomaticcarriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval-uate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.\\nBLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the\\nnumber or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDSpatient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis-ease is progressing, or whether certain treatments arehelping the patient. These cell count tests include:\\n• Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine analy-\\nsis performed on a sample of blood taken from thepatient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube.

AlthoughCBCs are used on more than just AIDS patients, they canhelp the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has anadvanced form of the disease.

B cells are sometimes called B lym-phocytes. They secrete antibody and have a numberof other complex functions within the humanimmune system.\\nCD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood\\nthat is present on the surface of 65% of human Tcells. CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When theHIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, itdepletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killercells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most ofthe damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system isdone by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lympho-cytes. CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen.\\nComplete blood count (CBC) —A routine analysis\\nperformed on a sample of blood taken from thepatient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. Themeasurements taken in a CBC include a white bloodcell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distri-bution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume ofthe red blood cells to the blood volume), and theamount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that car-ries oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used formany medical reasons and are not used only forAIDS patients. They can help the doctor determine if\\na patient is in advanced stages of the disease.\\nElectrophoresis —A method of separating complex\\nprotein molecules suspended in a gel by running anelectric current through the gel.\\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) —A\\ndiagnostic blood test used to screen patients forAIDS or other viruses. The patient’s blood is mixedwith antigen attached to a plastic tube or bead sur-face. A sample of the patient’s blood serum isadded, and excess proteins are removed. A secondantibody coupled to an enzyme is added, followedby a chemical that will cause a color reaction thatcan be measured by a special instrument.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) —A transmis-\\nsible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Twoforms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-es most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and SouthAmerica, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, whichis chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-covered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-1, but may also have a longer latency period.\\nImmunofluorescent assay (IFA) —A blood test\\nsometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofusing the Western blotting. In an IFA test, HIV anti-gen is mixed with a fluorescent compound and thenwith a sample of the patient’s blood. If HIV antibodyis present, the mixture will fluoresce when exam-ined under ultraviolet light.\\nLymphocyte —A type of white blood cell that is\\nimportant in the formation of antibodies. Doctors\\nof an immune response. Because HIV targets CD4+\\nlymphocytes, their number in the patient’s blood canbe used to track the course of the infection. This bloodcell count is considered the most accurate indicatorfor the presence of an opportunistic infection in anAIDS patient. The absolute CD4+ lymphocyte countis obtained by multiplying the patient’s white bloodcell count (WBC) by the percentage of lymphocytesamong the white blood cells, and multiplying theresult by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing theCD4+ marker. An absolute count below 200-300CD+4 lymphocytes in 1 cubic millimeter (mm\\n3) of\\nblood indicates that the patient is vulnerable to someopportunistic infections.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 84AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 84', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 78}), Document(page_content='• CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think that\\nthis is a more accurate test than the absolute countbecause the percentage does not depend on a manualcalculation of the number of types of different whiteblood cells.

HIV can infect and killmacrophages.\\nMonocyte —A large white blood cell that is formed\\nin the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of thewhite blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.\\nOpportunistic infection —An infection that devel-\\nops only when a person’s immune system is weak-ened, as happens to AIDS patients.\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) —A test performed\\nto evaluate false-negative results to the ELISA andWestern blot tests. In PCR testing, numerous copiesof a gene are made by separating the two strands ofDNA containing the gene segment, marking itslocation, using DNA polymerase to make a copy,and then continuously replicating the copies.

Human bloodserum is clear light yellow in color.\\nT cells —Lymphocytes that originate in the thymus\\ngland. T cells regulate the immune system’sresponse to infections, including HIV. CD4 lympho-cytes are a subset of T lymphocytes.\\nViral load test —A new blood test for monitoring the\\nspeed of HIV replication in AIDS patients. The viralload test is based on PCR techniques and supple-ments the CD4+ cell count tests.\\nWestern blot —A technique developed in 1979 that\\nis used to confirm ELISA results. HIV antigen is puri-fied by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to anylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum isreacted against the filter, followed by treatment withdeveloping chemicals that allow HIV antibody toshow up as a colored patch or blot. If the patient isHIV-positive, there will be stripes at specific loca-tions for two or more viral proteins. A negativeresult is blank.\\nWBC differential —A white blood cell count in\\nwhich the technician classifies the different whiteblood cells by type as well as calculating the num-ber of each type.

Another type of blood test\\nfor monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It sup-plements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor theextent of the patient’s loss of immune function, but notthe speed of HIV replication in the body.

Found in the viral\\ncore of HIV , p24 is a protein that can be measured bythe ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays tomeasure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-tions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful indetecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-er, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of personsinfected with HIV .\\nGENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic\\ntesting can help determine whether specific gene muta-tions, common in people with HIV , are causing drugresistance and drug failure. The test looks for specificgenetic mutations of within the virus that are known tocause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.For example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that havea mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-scriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V(M/L50478V , methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-\\ntance test shows a mutation at position M184V , it is like-ly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely torespond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are onlyeffective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-tion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies permilliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usuallybetween $300 and $500, is usually now covered bymany insurance plans.\\nPHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno-\\ntypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of apatient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.To do this, it measures the concentration of a drugrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. Thisis the same method used by researchers to determinewhether a drug might be effective against HIV beforeusing it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is amore direct measurement of resistance than genotypictesting. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-ing does not require a high viral load but it is recom-mended that persons already be taking antiretroviral\\ndrugs . The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now\\ncovered by many insurance plans.AIDS serology in children\\nChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire\\nthe infection through the mother’s placenta or during thebirth process. Public health experts recommend the test-ing and monitoring of all children born to mothers withHIV . Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 monthsis similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-firmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosedby direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24antigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician toidentify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS\\ndiagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take thepatient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-stances into account and to provide counseling before andafter testing. Patients are generally better able to cope withthe results if the doctor has spent some time with thembefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIVinfection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type ofinformational counseling before performing the tests.\\nAftercare\\nIf the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-\\nitive, he or she will need counseling, information, referralfor treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel thepatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-selor to discuss the results of the blood tests with thepatient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional andpsychological status, including the possibility of violentbehavior and the availability of a support network.\\nRisks\\nThe risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to\\ndisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to anyphysical risks connected with blood testing. Somepatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-nosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,resources, belief system, and similar factors.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, and\\nPCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.\\nNormal results for blood cell counts:\\n• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the\\nwhite blood cells.\\n• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 86AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 86', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 80}), Document(page_content='• T cell lymphocytes: 644-2200/mm3, 60-88% of all lym-\\nphocytes.\\n• B cell lymphocytes: 82-392/mm3, 3-20% of all lympho-\\ncytes.\\n• CD4+ lymphocytes: 500-1200/mm3, 34-67% of all\\nlymphocytes.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe following results in AIDS tests indicate progres-\\nsion of the disease:\\n• Percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes: less than 20% of all\\nlymphocytes.\\n• CD4+ lymphocyte count: less than 200 cells/mm3.\\n• Viral load test: Levels more than 5000 copies/mL.•/H9252-2-microglobulin: Levels more than 3.5 mg/dL.\\n• P24 antigen: Measurable amounts in blood serum.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAvrameas, Stratis, and Therese Ternynck. “Enzyme Linked\\nImmunosorbent Assay (ELISA).” In Encyclopedia of\\nImmunology.

It is probably the most specific test forliver damage. However, the severity of the liver damageis not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since theamount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higherALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,ALT levels may experience serious liver damage withoutan increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients withliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarilyindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they mayindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALTlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-tant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,within a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greaterfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers fromalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may begleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary for this test.\\nAftercare\\nThis test involves blood being drawn, probably from\\na vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep thewound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-dage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report anyunusual symptoms to their physician.\\nNormal results\\nNormal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nand should be available to your physician at the time ofthe test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-cates many laboratories find values from approximatelyseven to 50 IU/L to be normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nLow levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may\\nindicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000IU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-ins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usuallyresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart\\nattack ). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L thatresolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of the\\nbile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)may support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.\\nIt is important to note that persons with normal liv-\\ners may have slightly elevated levels of ALT.

The condition, which is found in all races, maybe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skincancer later in life.\\nDescription\\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five\\npeople per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.Other parts of the world have a much higher rate; forexample, albinism is found in about 20 out of every100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\\ncondition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” whichaffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,hair and skin remain pure white throughout life. Peoplewith a less severe form are born with white hair andskin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyonewith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormalflickering eye movements ( nystagmus ) and sensitivity\\nto bright light. There may be other eye problems aswell, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes(strabismus ).\\nThe second most common type of the condition is\\nknown as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lackcolor; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms ofocular albinism; some types cause more problems—especially eye problems—than others.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 88AlbinismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 82}), Document(page_content='Causes and symptoms\\nEvery cell in the body contains a matched pair of\\ngenes, one inherited from each parent.

Depending on whichnerve and muscle pathways are involved, alcohol canhave far-reaching effects on different parts of the brain,peripheral nerves, and muscles, with symptoms of mem-ory loss, incoordination, seizures, weakness, and senso-ry deficits. These different effects can be grouped inthree main categories: (1) intoxication due to the acuteeffects of ethanol, (2) withdrawal syndrome from sud-denly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related tolong-term or chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol-relatedneurologic disease includes Wernicke-Korsakoff dis-ease, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, alcoholicmyopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawalsyndrome with seizures and delirium tremens, and fetal\\nalcohol syndrome .\\nDescription\\nAcute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunken-\\nness (intoxication) or even death , and chronic or long-\\nterm abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage tovirtually any level of the nervous system.

Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especiallysodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pon-tine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in whichnerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease compli-cating alcoholic cirrhosis may cause dementia , deliri-\\num, and movement disorder.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhen a person drinks alcohol, it is absorbed by\\nblood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidlythroughout the body and brain, as ethanol freely crossesthe blood-brain barrier that ordinarily keeps large mole-cules from escaping from the blood vessel to the braintissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may occur at bloodethanol concentrations of as low as 50-150 mg per dL inpeople who don’t drink. Sleepiness, stupor, coma ,o r\\neven death from respiratory depression and low bloodpressure occur at progressively higher concentrations.\\nAlthough alcohol is broken down by the liver, the\\ntoxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely adirect result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdownproducts. The fatal dose varies widely because peoplewho drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects ofalcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol toleranceresults in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol toachieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli-hood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high andpotentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularlytrue when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting\\ndecreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes evenhigher blood alcohol levels.\\nWhen a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking,\\nwithdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increasedexcitability of the central nervous system, called deliri-um tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eighthours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72hours after abstinence. They include body shaking(tremulousness), insomnia , agitation, confusion, hear-\\ning voices or seeing images that are not really there(such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro-fuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever . Alcohol-\\nrelated seizures may also occur without withdrawal,such as during active heavy drinking or after more than aweek without alcohol.\\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi-\\nciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen inpeople who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi-amine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that preventsthe absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi-tion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy;the symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis-orientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness.Examination reveals abnormalities of eye movement,including jerking of the eyes ( nystagmus ) and double\\nvision. Problems with balance make walking difficult.People may have trouble coordinating their leg move-ments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not givenpromptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu-por, coma, and death.\\nIf thiamine is given and death averted, Korsakoff’s\\nsyndrome may develop in some patients, who suffer\\nfrom memory impairment that leaves them unable toremember events for a period of a few years before theonset of illness (retrograde amnesia ) and unable to learn\\nnew information (anterograde amnesia). Most patientshave very limited insight into their memory dysfunctionand have a tendency to make up explanations for eventsthey have forgotten (confabulation).\\nSevere alcoholism can cause cerebellar degenera-\\ntion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions ofthe brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver-mis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, andan inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. Thegait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, butmay be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenlyworsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.\\nFetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to\\nalcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanolretards fetal growth and development. Affected infantsoften have a distinctive appearance with a thin upper lip,flat nose and mid-face, short stature and small head size.Almost half are mentally retarded, and most others aremildly impaired intellectually or have problems withspeech, learning, and behavior.\\nAlcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to\\nbreakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholicrhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males areaffected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopathyfour times as often as females.

Symptoms usually worsen over hours to afew days, and then improve over the next week to 10days as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol. Musclesymptoms are usually generalized, but pain and swellingmay selectively involve the calves or other musclegroups. The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholicmyopathy may be worsened by crush injuries, whichmay occur when people drink so much that they com-press a muscle group with their body weight for a longtime without moving, or by withdrawal seizures withgeneralized muscle activity.\\nIn patients who abuse alcohol over many years,\\nchronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males andfemales are equally affected. Symptoms include pain-less weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunkand the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,shoulders, and upper arms. This weakness developsgradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms ofacute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk,may be striking. The nerves of the extremities may alsobegin to break down, a condition known as alcoholicperipheral neuropathy , which can add to the person’s\\ndifficulty in moving.\\nThe way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is\\nstill not well understood. Proposed mechanisms includemuscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal-cium, potassium, or other minerals ; impaired muscle\\nenergy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis.Alcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by theliver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanolis converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletalmuscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver functionmay affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing theamount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro-longed activity. Because not enough sugar is available tosupply needed energy, muscle protein may be brokendown as an alternate energy source. However, toxiceffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itselfrather than of its breakdown products.\\nAlthough alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con-\\ntribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring themotor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholicneuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers.Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning painin the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere with\\nwalking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases butnumbness increases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease\\ndepends largely on finding characteristic symptoms andsigns in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possiblecauses should be excluded by the appropriate tests,which may include blood chemistry, thyroid function\\ntests , brain MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) or CT\\n(computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinalfluid analysis.\\nAcute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by\\nfinding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatinekinase and other blood enzymes released from injuredmuscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of musclefor microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows thescattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc-tors must rule out other acquired causes of musclebreakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such asheroin, cocaine , or amphetamines; trauma with crush\\ninjury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or anunderlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates orlipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatinekinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro-phy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography\\n(EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholicmyopathy or neuropathy.\\nTreatment\\nAcute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium\\ntremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon-itor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure\\nthat may develop.

Alco-holism is the popular term for two disorders, alcoholabuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of boththese disorders involve repeated life problems that can bedirectly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor-ders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ-ual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impacton society at large.\\nDescription\\nThe effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching.\\nAlcohol affects every body system, causing a wide rangeof health problems. Some such problems include poornutrition , memory disorders, difficulty with balance and\\nwalking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and hepatitis),\\nhigh blood pressure, muscle weakness (including theheart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor-ders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinalinflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problemswith the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con-tent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak-ened bones.\\nOn a personal level, alcoholism results in marital\\nand other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy-ment, child abuse , and general family dysfunction.\\nAlcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of\\nsevere social problems including homelessness, murder,suicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a contribut-ing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi-cle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur eachyear due to the effects of alcohol, of which 50% are dueto injuries of some sort. According to a recent specialreport prepared for the U.S. Congress by the NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impactof alcohol on society, including violence, traffic acci-dents, lost work productivity, and premature death , costs\\nour nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi-tion, it is estimated that approximately one in four chil-dren (19 million children or 29 percent of children up to17 years of age) is exposed at some time to familial alco-hol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, ithas been estimated that approximately 18 percent ofadults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen-dence a some time during their lives.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are probably a number of factors that work\\ntogether to cause a person to become an alcoholic.Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel-atives of an alcoholic are four times more likely tobecome alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this riskholds true even for children who were adopted awayfrom their biological families at birth and raised in anon-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge oftheir biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. Moreresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic fac-tors could account for differences in alcohol metabo-lism that may increase the risk of an individual becom-ing an alcoholic.\\nThe symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down\\ninto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcoholuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.\\nImmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use\\nAlcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The\\nblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter-ing the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quicklybecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’sdepressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor bal-ance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 95AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 95', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 89}), Document(page_content='(accounting in part for the increased likelihood of\\ninjury). The affected person may also have impairment ofperiperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’sbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomitingmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathedinto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including thepossibility of pneumonia ). Still higher alcohol levels\\nmay result in coma and death.\\nEffects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism\\nLong-term use of alcohol affects virtually every\\norgan system of the body:\\n• Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in\\ntheir teens and twenties have experienced alcoholicblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantityof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the timesurrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overallsleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling may\\noccur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which canoccur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’sand Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the lowthiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels foundin alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-dered eye movements, very poor balance and difficultywalking, while Korsakoff’s syndrome severely\\naffects one’s memory, preventing new learning fromtaking place.\\n• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of\\nthe muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contentsfrom re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acidfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-gus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and\\nbleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also resultin bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. Amajor cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-orrhage) in an alcoholic is the development ofenlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,which are called esophageal varices. These varices areactually developed in response to liver disease, andare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.Diarrhea is a common symptom, due to alcohol’s\\neffect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation ofthe pancreas ( pancreatitis ) is a serious and painful\\nproblem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,alcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,creating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-ken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ isseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-hol interferes with a number of important chemicalprocesses that also occur in the liver. The liver beginsto enlarge and fill with fat ( fatty liver ), fibrous scartissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure and\\nfunction (cirrhosis), and the liver may becomeinflamed (hepatitis).\\n• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of\\nblood cells. Red blood cells become abnormallylarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-tions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakenedimmune system. This places alcoholics at increasedrisk for infections, and is thought to account in partfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics\\n(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and bloodclotting factors are affected, causing an increased riskof bleeding.\\n• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood\\npressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins toincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range. Highlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase therisk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in anincrease in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,abnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots formingwithin the chambers of the heart, and a greatlyincreased risk of stroke (due to a blood clot from the\\nheart entering the circulatory system, going to thebrain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).\\n• Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative\\neffect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas-ing testicle and ovary size, and interfering with bothsperm and egg production. When pregnancy is\\nachieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a greatrisk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome , which\\ncauses distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, andbehavioral problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nTwo different types of alcohol-related difficulties\\nhave been identified. The first is called alcohol depen-\\ndence , which refers to a person who literally depends on\\nthe use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must bepresent to diagnose alcohol dependence:\\n• tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed\\nto a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase thedose in order to obtain the desired effect\\n• withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences\\nunpleasant physical and psychological symptoms whenhe or she does not drink alcohol\\n• the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends\\n(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it dif-ficult to stop)\\n• being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once\\nstarted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 96AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 96', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 90}), Document(page_content='• having large blocks of time taken up by alcohol use\\n• choosing to drink at the expense of other important\\ntasks or activities\\n• drinking despite evidence of negative effects on one’s\\nhealth, relationships, education, or job\\nAlcohol abuse requires that one of the following four\\ncriteria is met. Because of drinking, a person repeatedly:\\n• fails to live up to his or her most important responsibili-\\nties\\n• physically endangers him or herself, or others (for\\nexample, by drinking when driving)\\n• gets into trouble with the law• experiences difficulties in relationships or jobs\\nDiagnosis is sometimes brought about when family\\nmembers call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the attentionof a physician. A clinician may begin to be suspiciouswhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins toexperience medical problems related to the use of alco-hol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of aphysician’s patients will be alcoholics.\\nDiagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-\\nlogical assessments that try to determine what aspects ofa person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-hol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-son drinks is of much less importance than determininghow his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-tional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-lism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-es alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-sumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing eitheralcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.\\nOne very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of\\nalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consistsof four questions, with the first letters of each key wordspelling out the word CAGE:\\n• Have you ever tried to Cutdown on your drinking?\\n• Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments\\nabout your drinking?\\n• Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?• Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of\\nalcohol) to start the day)?\\nOther, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-\\nmine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.Given the recent research pointing to a genetic basisfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whetheranyone else in the person’s family has ever sufferedfrom alcoholism.\\nPhysical examination may reveal signs suggestive\\nof alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible networkof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen ( ascites );\\nyellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size inmen; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal anincrease in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalitiesin the white blood cells (cells responsible for fightinginfection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-ting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step\\nin the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification ,\\ninvolves helping the person stop drinking and ridding hisor her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.Because the person’s body has become accustomed toalcohol, the person will need to be supported throughwithdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for differentpatients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, asmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and thelength of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-drawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-rhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety , and trem-\\nbling. This phase is usually over in about three to fivedays. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu-\\ncinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-\\nthing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearablecraving for more alcohol, confusion, fever , fast heart rate,\\nhigh blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of\\nconsciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severesymptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens)are those with other medical problems, including malnu-\\ntrition , liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome.

No medications are necessary,however. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severeeffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-ications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and toavoid the potentially life-threatening complications of highblood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs calledbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients sufferingfrom hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluidsmay need to be given through a vein (intravenously), alongwith some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-amine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usuallyquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamineis responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\\nAfter cessation of drinking has been accomplished,\\nthe next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-ing another drink. This phase of treatment is referred toas rehabilitation . The best programs incorporate the\\nfamily into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-edly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.Some therapists believe that family members, in an effortto deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-times develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-port or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation isreferred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed inorder to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.\\nSessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics\\nmeet regularly and provide support for each other’srecoveries, are considered some of the best methods ofpreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps themost well-known such group is called AlcoholicsAnonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-ple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing thedestructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-holic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-coming the problem, and reflecting on the ways inwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-ble, making amends to those people. According to arecent study reported by the American PsychologicalAssociation (APA), anyone, regardless of his or herreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefitfrom participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-holics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groupsexceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-sionals combined.\\nThere are also medications that may help an alco-\\nholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been usedwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug\\nwhich, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-tions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.Naltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-prosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of thesemedications would be helpful unless the patient was alsowilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the\\nalcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawalhas passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressfullives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism issometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments foralcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress . These\\ninclude massage, meditation , and hypnotherapy . The\\nmalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to ahealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such asvitamins A, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty\\nacids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbaltreatments include milk thistle( Silybum marianum ), which\\nis thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbsare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering throughwithdrawal. Some of these include lavender ( Lavandula\\nofficinalis ), skullcap ( Scutellaria lateriflora ), chamomile\\n(Matricaria recutita ), peppermint ( Mentha piperita )\\nyarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and valerian ( Valeriana\\nofficinalis ). Acupuncture is believed to both decrease\\nwithdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’schances for continued recovery from alcoholism.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In\\nfact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-aged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-holic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because mostresearchers in the field believe that since the potential foralcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological andpsychological makeup, one can never fully recover fromalcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)is always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics instable financial and family situations who have undergonetreatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt tostop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention must begin at a relatively young age\\nsince the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness) usu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 98AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 98', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 92}), Document(page_content='ally occurs during the teenage years.

Testing for aldolase is done todiagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases.\\nPurpose\\nSkeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level\\nfound in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are thosemuscles attached to bones and whose contractions makethose bones move. When the muscles are diseased ordamaged, such as in muscular dystrophy , the cells dete-\\nriorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ-ing aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring theamount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree ofmuscle damage.\\nAs muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels\\ndecrease and eventually fall below normal. Less musclemeans fewer cells and less aldolase.\\nMuscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as\\nwell as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolaselevels can help pinpoint the cause.

Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.\\nThe patient should avoid strenuous exercise and\\nhave nothing to eat or drink, except water, for eight to tenhours before this test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure tothe puncture site until the bleeding stops will reducebruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relievediscomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNewborns have the highest normal aldolase levels\\nand adults the lowest. Normal values will vary based onthe laboratory and the method used.\\nAbnormal results\\nAs noted, aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle dis-\\neases, such as muscular dystrophies. Duchenne’s muscu-lar dystrophy, the most common type of muscular dystro-phy, will increase the aldolase level more than any otherdisease.\\nNondisease conditions that affect the muscle, such\\nas injury, gangrene , or an infection, can also increase the\\naldolase level. Also, strenuous exercise can temporarilyincrease a person’s aldolase level.Certain medications can increase the aldolase level,\\nwhile others can decrease it. To interpret what the resultsof the aldolase test mean, a physician will evaluate theresult, the person’s clinical symptoms, and other teststhat are more specific for muscle damage and disease.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nA Manual of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests. 5th ed.

Secondary aldosteronism ismore common and may occur with congestive heart fail-\\nure,cirrhosis with fluid in the abdominal cavity\\n(ascites ), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium,\\nsodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy .\\nTo differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-\\nondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per-formed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin,an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondaryaldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism.\\nDescription\\nAldosterone testing can be performed on a blood\\nsample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors,including diet, posture (upright or lying down), and timeof day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosteronelevels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short-term fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over anentire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter-fering factors and provides a more reliable aldosteronemeasurement.\\nPreparation\\nFasting is not required for either the blood sample\\nor urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor-mal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for atleast two weeks before either test. The doctor shoulddecide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluidbalance (e.g., diuretics , antihypertensives, steroids, oral\\ncontraceptives ) should be withheld. The test will be\\nmore accurate if these are suspended at least two weeksbefore the test. Renin inhibitors (e.g., propranolol)should not be taken one week before the test, unless per-mitted by the physician. The patient should avoid licoricefor at least two weeks before the test, because of itsaldosterone-like effect. Strenuous exercise and stress\\ncan increase aldosterone levels as well. Because the testis usually performed by a method called radioimmunoas-say, recently administered radioactive medications willaffect test results.\\nSince posture and body position affect aldosterone,\\nhospitalized patients should remain in an upright position(at least sitting) for two hours before blood is drawn.Occasionally blood will be drawn again before thepatient gets out of bed. Nonhospitalized patients shouldarrive at the laboratory in time to maintain an uprightposition for at least two hours.Risks\\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nNormal results are laboratory-specific and also vary\\nwith sodium intake, with time of day, source of specimen(e.g., peripheral vein, adrenal vein, 24-hour urine), age,sex, and posture.\\nReference ranges for blood include:\\n• supine (lying down): 3-10 ng/dL• upright (sitting for at least two hours): Female: 5-\\n30ng/dL; Male: 6-22 ng/dL\\nReference ranges for urine: 2-80 mg/24 hr.\\nAbnormal results\\nIncreased levels of aldosterone are found in Conn’s\\ndisease (aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor), and incases of Bartter’s syndrome (a condition in which thekidneys overexcrete potassium, sodium and chloride,resulting in low blood levels of potassium and high bloodlevels of aldosterone and renin). Among other condi-tions, elevated levels are also seen in secondary aldos-teronism, stress, and malignant hypertension .\\nDecreased levels of aldosterone are found in aldos-\\nterone deficiency, steroid therapy, high-sodium diets ,\\ncertain antihypertensive therapies, and Addison’s dis-\\nease (an autoimmune disorder).\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nJacobs, David S., et al.

Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-body that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found onthe surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that isused to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cellsof patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocyticleukemia (B-CLL).\\nPurpose\\nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat\\nB-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronicleukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found onthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immunesystem. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant Bcells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-tion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-body-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that theimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.\\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease tobe classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-darabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,this drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-ments for B-CLL another option. As most patients withB-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylatingagents and fludarabine have been tried, the experiencewith alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with thosestages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% ofpatients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% ofthese being complete responses.\\nThis antibody has been tested with limited success\\nin the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) andfor the preparation of patients with various immune cellmalignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There isalso a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti-body to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation.\\nDescription\\nAlemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using\\ngenetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like allantibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic-ular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody.For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein foundon the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells aswell as other cells of the immune and male reproductivesystems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-ing that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips ofthe Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but therest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence ofthe human sequences helps to reduce the immuneresponse by the patient against the antibody itself, aproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are usedfor cancer therapies. The human sequences also help toensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms ofthe human immune system are properly triggered withbinding of the antibody.\\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for usealone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti-body to be used in combination with the purine analogspentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, amonoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,another protein found on the surface of B cells.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThis antibody should be administered in a gradually\\nescalating pattern at the start of treatment and any timeadministration is interrupted for seven or more days. Therecommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is adaily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-hour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the doseis increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose,it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days aweek. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro-choride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu-sion to help reduce side effects.\\nAdditionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-\\ntive medication before treatment to help minimize theserious opportunistic infections that can result from thistreatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre-vent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial todecrease infections, although they were not eliminated.\\nPrecautions\\nBlood studies should be done on a weekly basis\\nwhile patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat-ment. Vaccination during the treatment session is notrecommended, given the T cell depletion that occursduring treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodieslike alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to thedeveloping fetus and in breast milk, use during preg-nancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unlessclearly needed.\\nSide effects\\nA severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is the\\npossible depletion of one or more types of blood cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 102AlemtuzumabGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 102', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 96}), Document(page_content='Because CD52 is expressed on a patient’s normal B and\\nT cells, as well as on the surface of the abnormal B cells,the treatment eliminates both normal and cancerouscells.

Excessivetension, which Frederick Alexander, the originator, rec-ognized as both physical and mental, restricts movementand creates pressure in the joints, the spine, the breathingmechanism, and other organs. The goal of the techniqueis to restore freedom and expression to the body andclear thinking to the mind.\\nPurpose\\nBecause the Alexander technique helps students\\nimprove overall functioning, both mental and physical, itoffers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in his1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improvements insuch diverse things as high blood pressure, breathing,depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness,resilience against outside pressures, and the refined skillof playing a musical instrument.” He went on to quote alist of other conditions helped by the Alexander tech-nique: “rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis,then respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal asth-\\nma; following in their wake, circulation defects, which\\nmay lead to high blood pressure and also to some danger-ous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of manytypes, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures,migraines and depressive states.”\\nLiterature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to include\\nimprovements in back pain , chronic pain, postural prob-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 103Alexander techniqueGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 103', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 97}), Document(page_content='lems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during pregnancy\\nand childbirth , help in applying physical therapy and\\nrehabilitative exercises, improvements in strain caused bycomputer use, improvements in the posture and perfor-mance of school children, and improvements in vocal anddramatic performance among the benefits offered by thetechnique.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nFrederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in\\nTasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shake-spearean reciter, and early in his career he began to sufferfrom strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-tion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with arecommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,his problem persisted.\\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began about\\nan hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that itwas something he did in the process of reciting thatcaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medicaldoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When thedoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander wasdoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to tryand find out for himself.\\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself inthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve hiscoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One ofhis most startling discoveries was that in order to changethe way he used his body he had to change the way hewas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way thathe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-ed speech or movement. After making this discovery atthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became apioneer in body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints andto improve the expression and spontaneity of theirperformances. Soon a great number of people soughthelp from his teaching for a variety of physical andmental disorders.\\nThe Alexander technique is primarily taught one-\\non-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops orworkshops for special applications of the technique(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-vate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,and are taught in a series. The number of lessons variesaccording to the severity of the student’s difficultieswith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-est in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-\\ntinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 perhour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, butdiscounts are available for participants in some comple-mentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible SpendingAccounts for health care cover Alexander techniquelessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortableclothing) and use their hands to help students identifyand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arisesfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discussionsof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in thecourse of a lesson.\\nThe technique helps students move with ease and\\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a move-ment (the lessons are a series of movements), mostpeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulderstoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tightentheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension intheir bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse ofthe body.\\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be\\nestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, thehead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simplybecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out ofbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series ofstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It isskillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity inthe feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathingmechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons inthe technique aim to develop.\\nAlexander found that optimal functioning of the\\nbody was very hard to maintain, even for the short periodof time it took to complete a single movement. People,especially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-ated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles iscommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-visions or video monitors, too much sitting or drivingand too little walking, or by tension associated with pasttraumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after awhiplash injury or favoring a broken or sprained leg\\nlong after it has healed are examples of habitual tensioncaused by injury.\\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-\\nnique does is to increase a student’s sensory awarenessof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that inthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibitthe tension. If the student prepares to sit down, forexample, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.If he is asked to put aside the intention to sit andinstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 104Alexander techniqueGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 98}), Document(page_content='his muscles, he can begin to change his tense habitual\\nresponse to sitting.\\nBy leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur-\\nal free balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, notheld in a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release,the knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen,a student greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu-dents learn to direct themselves this way in activity andbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.\\nPrecautions\\nSide effects\\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational.\\nTeachers use their hands simply to gently guide studentsin movement. Therefore, both contraindications andpotential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-mum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-ture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the caseof errors in teaching, is unlikely.\\nAs students’ sensory awareness develops in the\\ncourse of Alexander lessons, they become more acutelyaware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn torelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustainthis release in daily activity, they may experience tight-ness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is causedby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened andreleased muscles and the expanded range of movementin the joints.\\nOccasionally students may get light-headed during a\\nlesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-latory or respiratory functioning.\\nForceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures\\noften indicate suppression of emotion. As musclesrelease during or after an Alexander lesson, students mayexperience strong surges of emotion or sudden changesin mood. In some cases, somatic memories surface,bringing to consciousness past injury or trauma. This cancause extreme anxiety , and referrals may be made by the\\nteacher for counseling.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAlexander became well known among the intellectu-\\nal, artistic, and medical communities in London, Eng-land, during the first half of the twentieth century.Among Alexander’s supporters were John Dewey,Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw, and renowned scientistsRaymond Dart, G.E.

Like all enzymes, it is needed, in smallamounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When itis present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liverdisease or a tumor.\\nPurpose\\nMedical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned\\nwith the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta,and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkalinephosphate and other substances is continually drainedaway through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bileduct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver.Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventuallyescapes into the bloodstream.\\nThe alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by\\nthe cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.Its origin differs from that of other enzymes calledaminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of anobstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliarydrainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be thefirst and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the otherhand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato-cytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus,these enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the typeof liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular.\\nGrowing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any con-\\ndition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphataselevels to rise. The condition may be normal, such as achildhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken bone;or the condition may be a disease, such as bone cancer ,\\nPaget’s disease, or rickets.\\nDuring pregnancy , alkaline phosphatase is made by\\nthe placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream.This is normal. Some tumors, however, start productionof the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by theplacenta. These tumors are called germ cell tumors andinclude testicular cancer and certain brain tumors.\\nAlkaline phosphatase from the intestine is increased\\nin a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such asulcerative colitis .\\nDescription\\nAlkaline phosphatase is measured by combining the\\nperson’s serum with specific substances with which alka-line phosphatase is known to react. The end product ofthis reaction is measured; and from that measurement,the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serumis determined.\\nEach tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine—\\nproduces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. Thesevariations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka-line phosphatase is measured as the total amount or theamount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen-zymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, andother processes in the laboratory. Methods to measurethem separately are based on these differences.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary. Results are usually available the next day.\\nPreparation\\nTo collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a\\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upperarm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and insertsa needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.\\nA person being tested for alkaline phosphatase\\nshouldn’t have anything to eat or drink, except water, foreight to ten hours before the test. Some people releasealkaline phosphatase from the intestine into the blood-stream after eating.

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction\\nthat occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this\\nspecific fungus.\\nDescription\\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus . It is sometimes\\ngrouped together with other lung disorders characterizedby eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain typeof white blood cell in the blood—under the heading ofeosinophilic pneumonia . These disorders are also called\\nhypersensitivity lung diseases.\\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase are notclear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-ics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-\\ntaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are found\\nworldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,forests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.They are also found on wet paint, construction materials,and in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomialinfection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-pital. When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So thepatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes orcoughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-gradefever and lose their appetites.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\\namounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis .\\nThey may also develop a serious long-term form ofbronchiectasis , the formation of fibrous tissue in the\\nlungs.

ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-plication of cystic fibrosis .\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of\\nthe patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputumtests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor willbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-ening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or otherlung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-nosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:\\n• a history of asthma.• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a\\nchest x ray .\\n• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or\\ndestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).\\n• skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.\\n• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.•Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-\\nitins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form asolid that separates from the rest of the solution in thetest tube.\\n• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a\\nclass of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergicreactions to foreign particles.\\nOther criteria that may be used to support the diag-\\nnosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of\\nthe patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brownmucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain this\\ninformation include a complete blood count (CBC), a\\nsputum culture , a blood serum test of IgE levels, and\\na skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a\\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper layerof skin on the patient’s forearm about four inchesbelow the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgEantibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what iscalled a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-utes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized bythe eruption of a reddened, itching spot on the skin.\\nSome patients with ABPA will develop the so-calledlate reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,swollen area develops about six to eight hours after theinitial reaction.\\nAspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro-\\nscope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-nosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-\\ntured in the laboratory. Aspergillus is easy to culture, and\\ncan be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)preparations.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the\\npresence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs ofbronchiectasis.\\nTreatment\\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-\\ncorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth, and\\nwith bronchodilators .\\nAntifungal drugs are notused to treat ABPA because\\nit is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather\\nthan by direct infection of tissue.\\nFollow-up care\\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic\\ncheckups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. Aspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’slung capacity.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-\\nteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-ual improvement over time. The best indicator of a goodprognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.Patients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-op severe airway obstruction.\\nPrevention\\nABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a\\ncommon fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputumof most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-tect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-post piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet orrotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites ornewly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-tioners cleaned regularly. Some patients may be helpedby air filtration systems for their bedrooms or offices.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Aspergillosis.” In Professional Guide to Diseases. 5th ed.\\nSpringhouse, PA: Springhouse Corporation, 1995.\\nBeavis, Kathleen G. “Systemic Mycoses.” In Current Diagno-\\nsis.V ol. 9.

The skin is\\nthe most obvious site of reaction, but the joints, gastroin-testinal tract, and kidneys are also often affected.\\nAP affects approximately 35,000 people in the Unit-\\ned States each year. Most cases are children between theages of two and seven. Boys are affected more often thangirls, and most cases occur from late fall to winter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe-\\ncial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies aredesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.In some situations, antigen-antibody complexes canbecome too large to remain suspended in the blood-stream. When this occurs, they precipitate out andbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap-illary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.\\nThe source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.\\nAntigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec-tion. More than 75% of patients report having had aninfection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas-trointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP.Other complex molecules can act as antigens as well,including drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines. Other-\\nwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac-tion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that maycause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,and quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP includethose for typhoid, measles ,cholera , and yellow fever .\\nSymptoms\\nThe onset of AP may be preceded by a headache ,\\nfever , and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop an\\nitchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, andmay be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg-er, resembling a bruise. Rashes become purple and then\\nrust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev-eral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks,abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on thebody may also occur, especially in younger children.\\nJoint pain and swelling is common, especially in\\nthe knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almostall patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces).About half of all patients show blood in the urine, lowurine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement.Kidney failure may occur due to widespread obstructionof the capillaries in the filtering structures calledglomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of allpatients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro-tein in the urine.Less common symptoms include prolonged head-\\nache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum. Involve-ment of other organ systems may lead to heart attack\\n(myocardial infarction), inflammation of the pancreas(pancreatitis ), intestinal obstruction, or bowel perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and their\\ndevelopment, a careful medical history, and blood andurine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans (CT)\\nmay be performed to assess complications in the bowelor other internal organs.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of AP resolve completely without treat-\\nment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because ofthe possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin painrelievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids (like\\nprednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special-ists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requiresmonitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.\\nPatients with severe kidney complications may\\nrequire a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed.\\nEven after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels ofblood or protein in the urine may persist for months andrequire regular monitoring. Hypertension or kidney fail-\\nure may develop months or even years after the acutephase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis ortransplantation.\\nPlasmapheresis , which removes antibodies from\\nthe blood, has been tried for AP with mixed results.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people who develop AP become better on their\\nown after several weeks.

It affects between 10-20% of all people inthe United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-tor visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat\\nallergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of bothprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.\\nThere are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and\\nperennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at theirhighest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-nomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause ofsymptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all yearand is usually caused by home or workplace airbornepollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.Symptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-doors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst afterspending time indoors.\\nBoth types of allergies can develop at any age,\\nalthough onset in childhood through early adulthood ismost common. Although allergy to a particular substanceis not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run inthe family.” While allergies can improve on their ownover time, they can also become worse over time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAllergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-eign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigensets off a series of reactions designed to protect the bodyfrom infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactionsis triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is thecondition known as allergy, and the offending substanceis called an allergen.\\nLike all allergic reactions, AR involves a special\\nset of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passagesand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, calledimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,called granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-gens, they trigger release of the granules, which spillout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, includingblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,through special proteins called histamine receptors.Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-sels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leadingto the fluid collection, swelling, and increased rednesscharacteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the\\nitchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-gic rhinitis.\\nThe number of possible airborne allergens is enor-\\nmous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grassand tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in largeamounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a stickypollen which is less likely to become airborne. Differentplants release their pollen at different times of the year,so seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,summer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke aresponse. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected inthe pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur-ing allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after agood rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higheron warm, dry, windy days.\\nVirtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR. A\\nfew types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble forpeople include the following:\\n• ragweed• sagebrush\\n• lamb’s-quarters\\n• plantain• pigweed• dock/sorrel\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 111Allergic rhinitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 111', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 105}), Document(page_content='• tumbleweed\\nPerennial AR is often triggered by house dust, a\\ncomplicated mixture of airborne particles, many ofwhich are potent allergens. House dust contains some orall of the following:\\n• house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-\\nbers of microscopic insects called house mites. Theseharmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed bythe house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi-ly become airborne.\\n• animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes,\\nand dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred frompet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergyin many sensitive people.\\n• mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout the\\nhouse, including basements, bathrooms, air ducts, airconditioners, refrigerator drains, damp windowsills,mattresses, and stuffed furniture. Mildew and othermolds release airborne spores which circulate through-\\nout the house.\\nOther potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis\\ninclude the following:\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• perfume\\n• cosmetics• cleansers• copier chemicals• industrial chemicals\\n• construction material gases\\nSymptoms\\nInflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major\\nsymptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching , sneezing,\\nrunny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling canconstrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner earto the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-ping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the backof the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, canalso lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually alsocauses redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and\\nheadache are also common.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can\\noften be done without a medical specialist. When symp-toms appear in spring or summer and disappear with theonset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainlythe culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection,can usually be ruled out by a physical examination and\\na nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on aswab for examination.\\nAllergy tests , including skin testing and provoca-\\ntion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, butmay not be done unless a single source is suspected andsubsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involvesplacing a small amount of liquid containing a specificallergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching,or injecting it into the skin surface to observe whetherredness and swelling occurs. Provocation testinginvolves challenging an individual with either a smallamount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if aresponse is elicited.\\nPerennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care-\\nful questioning about the timing of exposure and theonset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identifiedthrough allergy skin testing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 112Allergic rhinitis\\nThis illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the\\nnose after inhalation of airborne pollen.

When it is not possible to avoidone or more allergens, there are two major forms of med-ical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.\\nDrugs\\nANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-\\nmine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect ofhistamine release by mast cells. They may be used aftersymptoms appear, though they may be even more effec-tive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. Awide variety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a\\nmajor side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol-lowing:\\n• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)\\n• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)\\n• clemastine (Tavist and generics).\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness\\nare available by prescription and include the following:\\n• astemizole (Hismanal)\\n• loratidine (Claritin)\\n• fexofenadine (Allegra)• azelastin HCl (Astelin).\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery-\\nthromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal liningand oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestantsare stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and bloodpressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges-tants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective-ness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passagesbecome more severely swollen than before treatment.\\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos-\\nteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are\\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become worseas the season progresses because the immune system\\nbecomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro-duce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroidsare especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti-zation because they work more slowly and last longerthan most other medication types. As a result, they arebest started before allergy season begins. Side effects areusually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds,and unpleasant taste sensations.\\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents\\nthe release of mast cell granules, thereby preventingrelease of histamine and the other chemicals contained inthem. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever-al weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can beused for perennial AR as well.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in thebody, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergicreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testingto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injectionsinvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts ofallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodicboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years toachieve and are not seen at all in about one in fivepatients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitoredclosely following each shot because of the small risk ofanaphylaxis , a condition that can result in difficulty\\nbreathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AR often focus on modu-\\nlation of the body’s immune response, and frequentlycenter around diet and lifestyle adjustments. Chineseherbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s system, ascan both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment.Vitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize themucous membrane response. For symptom relief, west-ern herbal remedies including eyebright ( Euphrasia\\nofficinalis ) and nettle ( Urtica dioica ) may be helpful.\\nBee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or elimi-nating AR symptoms.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people with AR can achieve adequate relief\\nwith a combination of preventive strategies and treat-ment. While allergies may improve over time, they mayalso get worse or expand to include new allergens. Earlytreatment can help prevent an increased sensitization toother allergens.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 113Allergic rhinitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 113', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 107}), Document(page_content='Prevention\\nReducing exposure to pollen may improve symp-\\ntoms of seasonal AR.

It is estimated that 60 million Americans, ormore than one in every five people, suffer from someform of allergy, with similar proportions throughoutmuch of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largestreason for school absence and is a major source of lostproductivity in the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorganismsor particles by producing specific proteins called anti-bodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-tifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off aseries of chemical reactions designed to protect thebody from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substancessuch as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When thisoccurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub-stance (an allergen.)\\nMast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac-\\ntions, capture and display a particular type of antibody,called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller-gens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packetscalled granules. Granules contain a variety of potentchemicals, including histamine.\\nImmunologists separate allergic reactions into two\\nmain types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, whichare predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur withinminutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen-sitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of whiteblood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure.\\nInhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi-\\nate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti-bodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con-tents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ-ing blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to thesurfaces of these other cells through special proteinscalled histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine withreceptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness,leading to the fluid collection, swelling and increasedredness. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, mak-\\ning tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms lastfrom one to several hours following contact.\\nIn the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood-shot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis . In the gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation ofthe intestinal lining, which causes the cramping anddiarrhea typical of food allergy. Allergens that enter thecirculation may cause hives , angioedema, anaphylaxis ,\\nor atopic dermatitis .\\nAllergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,setting in motion a more prolonged immune response.This type of allergic response may develop over severaldays following contact with the allergen, and symptomsmay persist for a week or more.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAllergens enter the body through four main routes:\\nthe airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and thecirculatory system.\\n• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,\\nand itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhini-\\ntis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the\\nlungs, causing asthma , or the conjunctiva of the eyes,\\ncausing conjunctivitis (pink eye). Exposure to cock-\\nroach allergans have been associated with the devel-opment of asthma. Airborne allergans from householdpets are another common source of environmentalexposure.\\n• Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the\\nlips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbedinto the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria)or more severe reactions involving recurrent, non-inflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes,organs, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergensmay cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threateningcondition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric-tion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods suchcow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts andsoybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-bles may also occur.\\n• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-\\ning, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis .\\nSkin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-duced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.This type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis .\\nDermatitis may arise from an allergic response (suchas from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causingnonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold,and chemical agents).\\n• Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stings or\\ndrug administration, can introduce allergens directlyinto the circulation, where they may cause system-wideresponses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the localones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.\\nPeople with allergies are not equally sensitive to\\nall allergens.

Allergies may\\nget worse over time. For example, childhood ragweedallergy may progress to year-round dust and pollenallergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergicsensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap-pears in almost all people. More commonly, whatseems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reducedexposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for thesame level of symptoms.\\nWhile allergy to specific allergens is not inherited,\\nthe likelihood of developing some type of allergy seemsto be, at least for many people. If neither parent hasallergies, the chances of a child developing allergy isapproximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.Onesource of this genetic predisposition is in the ability toproduce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.Those who produce more IgE will develop a strongerallergic sensitivity.\\nCOMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne\\nallergens are the following:\\n• plant pollens\\n• animal fur and dander\\n• body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures\\nfound in all houses)\\n• house dust• mold spores• cigarette smoke• solvents• cleaners\\nCommon food allergens include the following:\\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and brazil nuts\\n• fish, mollusks, and shellfish• eggs• wheat• milk• food additives and preservatives\\nThe following types of drugs commonly cause aller-\\ngic reactions:\\n• penicillin or other antibiotics\\n• flu vaccines\\n• tetanus toxoid vaccine• gamma globulin\\nCommon causes of contact dermatitis include the\\nfollowing:• poison ivy, oak, and sumac\\n• nickel or nickel alloys• latex\\nInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stings\\ntypically cause allergy include the following:\\n• bees, wasps, and hornets• mosquitoes• fleas• scabies\\nSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergic\\nreaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,runny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat dueto post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membranecovering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness,irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus-es wheezing , coughing, and shortness of breath . Symp-\\ntoms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi-tive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys-temically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinalsymptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips,tongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; andgas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy,weepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. Itsometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such asa glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands,wrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear-lobes by wearing earrings.\\nWhole body or systemic reactions may occur from\\nany type of allergen, but are more common followingingestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactionsinclude the raised, reddened, and itchy patches calledhives that characteristically blanch with pressure andresolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and moreextensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluidcollection and pain, is called angioedema. This usuallyoccurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of thehead,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airwayconstriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissueswelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases,loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include, dizzi-\\nness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp-\\ning. The symptoms may begin within five minutes afterexposure to the allergan up to one hour or more later.Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in the bloodrelease mediators that give rise to the clinical symptomsof this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction.

Allergy is suspected ifthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergicreaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure tothe suspected allergan. Allergy tests can be used to\\nidentify potential allergens, but these must be supportedby eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini-cal history.\\nSkin tests\\nSkin tests are performed by administering a tiny\\ndose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is appliedto the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back,forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller-gen may produce a classic immune wheal and flareresponse (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressiblearea surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually beginwith prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin to\\nsmall amounts of allergen to observe the response. Apositive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller-gen is at levels normally encountered in food or in theairways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximatelyfifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin testsinvolved injection of the allergan into the dermis of theskin. These tests are more sensitive and are used forallergies associated with risk of death , such as allergies\\nto antibiotics.\\nAllergen-Specific IgE Measurement\\nTests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies\\ngenerally follow a basic method. The allergen is boundto a solid support, either in the form of a cellulosesponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’sserum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubatedwith the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodiesare present, they will bind to the solid phase and beretained there when the rest of the serum is washedaway. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is addedand will bind to any IgE on the solid phase. The excessis washed away and the levels of IgE are determined.The commonly used RAST test (radio allergo sorbent\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 117Allergies\\nAllergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by\\nexposure to household dust, animal fur,or pollen.

Someresearch indicates that there is a higher level of totalserum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo-ple. However, this may not always be the case as there isconsiderable overlap between the two groups.This test isuseful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis and\\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis . Other conditions that\\nare not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev-els such as smoking ,AIDS , infection with parasites,\\nand IgE myeloma.\\nProvocation tests\\nThese tests involve the administration of allergen to\\nellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-monly done with airborne allergens, present the allergendirectly through the route normally involved. Delayedallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similarmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen toinduce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca-tion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen fortwo weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measuredamount of the test substance administered as an opaquecapsule along with a placebo control. Provocation testsare not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to thepatient’s medical history.\\nFuture diagnostic methods\\nAs of 2000, attempts have been made for direct\\nmeasurement of immune mediators such as histamine,eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast celltryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec-trodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing.This test has been used in Europe and is under investiga-tion in the United States, though not approved by theFood and Drug Administration. An electric potential isapplied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec-trical resistance observed for changes. This method hasnot been verified.\\nTreatment\\nAvoiding allergens is the first line of defense to\\nreduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful toavoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke,perfumes, household cleaning agents, paints, glues, airfresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide from poorly\\nvented gas stoves, woodburing stoves, and artificial fire-places has also been linked to poor asthma control. Dustmite control is particularly important in the bedroomareas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattressand pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hotwater,and removal of items that collect dust such asstuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducingindoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduceindoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys-tems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such asthe bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals shouldavoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts,urine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet,restriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of thehome may be beneficial.\\nComplete environmental control is often difficult to\\naccomplish, hence therapuetic interventions maybecome necessary. A large number of prescription andover-the-counter drugs are available for treatment ofimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of thesework by decreasing the ability of histamine to provokesymptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista-mine by stimulating other systems or reducing immuneresponses in general.\\nAntihistamines\\nAntihistamines block the histamine receptors on\\nnasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine releasedby mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,though they may be even more effective when used pre-ventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines arehelp reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. A widevariety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder, first generation antihistamines often produce\\ndrowsiness as a major side effect, as well as dry mouth ,\\ntachycardia, blurred vision, constipation , and lower the\\nthreshold for seizures. These medicatios also have simi-lar effects to a alcohol and care should be taken whenoperating motor vehicles, as individuals may not beaware that they are impared. Such antihistamines includethe following:\\n• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)• clemastine (Tavist and generics)\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness\\nor pass the blood-brain barrier are available by prescrip-tion and include the following:\\n• loratidine (Claritin)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 118AllergiesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 118', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 112}), Document(page_content='• fexofenadine (Allegra)\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery-\\nthromycin,the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDecongestants\\nDecongestants constrict blood vessels to the\\nmucosa to counteract the effects of histamine. Thisdecreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngealand sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal lin-ing and oral systemicpreparations are available. Decon-gestants are stimulants and may cause increased heartrate and blood pressure, headaches,insomnia,agitation,and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of topicaldecongestants for longer than several days can causeloss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in whichnasal passages become more severely swollen than\\nbefore treatment.\\nTopical corticosteroids\\nTopical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane\\ninflammationas by decreasing the amount of fluidmoved from the vascular spaces into the tissues. Thesemedications reduce the recruitment of inflammatorycells as well as the synthesis of cytokines. They areavailable by prescription. Allergies tend to becomeworse as the season progresses because the immune sys-tem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and canproduce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticos-teroids are especially effective at reducing this seasonalsensitization because they work more slowly and lastlonger than most other medication types. As a result,they are best started before allergy season begins. Sideeffects are usually mild, but may include headaches,nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.\\nBronchodilators or metered-dose inhalers (MDI)\\nBecause allergic reactions involving the lungs cause\\nthe airways or bronchial tubes to narrow, as in asthma,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 119Allergies\\nIn a future exposure to the same substance,\\nthe antibodies on the mast cells bind to theallergens, and the cells release their histamine.\\nHistamine travels to receptor sites in the nasalpassages.

Calamine lotion appliedto affected skin can reduce irritation somewhat, as cancold water compresses. Side effects of topical agentsmay include over-drying of the skin.In the case of acutecontact dermatitis, short-term oral corticosteroid therapymay be appropriate. Moderately strong coricosteroidscan also be applied as a wrap for twenty-four hours.Health care workers are especially at risk for hand erup-tions due to glove use.\\nTreatment of anaphylaxis\\nThe emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treated\\nwith injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.People who are prone to anaphylaxis because of food orinsect allergies often carry an “Epi-pen” containingadrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Other medicationsmay be given to aid the action of the epi-pen. Promptinjection can prevent a more serious reaction fromdeveloping. Paticular care should be taken to assess theaffected individual’s airway status, and he or she shouldbe placed in a recumbent pose and vital signs deter-mined. If a reaction resulted from insect sting or aninjection, a tourniquet may need to be placed proximalto the area where the agent penetrated the skin. Thisshould then be released at intervals of ten minutes at atime, for one to two minutes duration. If the individualdoes not respond to such interventions, then emergency\\ntreatment is appropriate.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAny alternative treatment for allergies begins with\\nfinding the cause and then helping the patient to avoidor eliminate the allergen, although this is not alwayspossible. As with any alternative therapy, a physicianshould be consulted before initiating a new form oftreatment. Education on the use of alternative agents iscritical, as they are still “drugs” even though they arederived from natural sources.Various categories ofalternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat-ment, including:\\n• antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes-\\nperidin act as natural anithistamines.\\n• decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies\\nFerrum phosphoricum and Kali muriaticum (used alter-\\nnately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteineare believed to have decongestant effects.\\n• mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin and\\nhesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.\\n• immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea (Echinacea spp.)\\nand astragalus or milk-vetch root ( Astragalus mem-\\nbranaceus ) may possibly help to strengthen the\\nimmune system.\\n• bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra ( Ephedra\\nsinica , also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine ), khellin ( Ammi visnaga ) and cramp bark\\n(Viburnum opulus ) are believed to help open the airways.\\nTreatment of contact dermatitis\\nA variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-\\nly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat-ment of contact dermatitis.

For food allergies, there is no effectivetreatment except avoidance. By determining the allergensthat are causing reactions, most people can learn to avoidallergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact allergenssuch as poison ivy or latex. Airborne allergens are moredifficult to avoid, although keeping dust and animal dan-der from collecting in the house may limit exposure.Cromolyn sodium can prevent mast cell degranulation,thereby limiting the allergic response.\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types inthe body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to causeallergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by aller-gy testing to determine the precise allergens responsi-ble. Injections involve very small but graduallyincreasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks ormonths, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may takeup to several years to achieve and are not seen at all inabout one in five patients. Individuals receiving allshots will be monitored closely following each shotbecause of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a conditionthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp dropin blood pressure.\\nOther drugs, including steroids, are used to prevent\\nasthma attacks and in the long-term management of asthma.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKemp, Stephen F. and Richard Lockey, editors.

Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on theforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen. Common inhaledallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tinyhouse mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,and milk.\\nAllergic reactions involve a special set of cells in\\nthe immune system known as mast cells. Mast cellsserve as guards in the tissues where the body meets theoutside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of theeyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratoryand digestive systems. Mast cells display a special typeof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), ontheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicalsin small packets, called granules. When the antibodiesencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of thesechemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of theseother cells, through special proteins called histaminereceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors onblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increasedredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritatedeyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing\\nthe itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common inallergic rhinitis .\\nThe particular allergens to which a person is sensi-\\ntive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergytests may be performed on the skin or using blood serumin a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens areplaced on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio-allergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s bloodserum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter-mine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provo-cation testing involves direct exposure to a likely aller-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 122Allergy testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 122', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 116}), Document(page_content='gen, either through inhalation or ingestion. Positive reac-\\ntions from any of these tests may be used to narrow thecandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.\\nIdentification of the allergenic substance may allow\\nthe patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergicreactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done inthose with asthma that is difficult to manage, eczema, or\\nskin rashes to determine if an allergy is causing the con-\\ndition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be donebefore allergen desensitization to ensure the safety ofmore extensive exposure.\\nSkin testing is the most common type of allergy test.\\nThere are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. Inpercutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions areplaced on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with aneedle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin andbecome exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in whichthe skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used lessoften. Intradermal testing involves directly injectingallergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,swollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub-stance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity isseen for allergens regardless of whether they usuallyaffect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller-gens cause skin reactions equally well.\\nThe range of allergens used for testing is chosen to\\nreflect possible sources in the environment and mayinclude the following:\\n• pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and\\nweeds\\n• mold and fungus spores• house dust• house mites• animal skin cells (dander) and saliva• food extracts• antibiotics• insect venoms\\nRadio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory\\ntest performed when a person may be too sensitive to riskskin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre-vent it.\\nProvocation testing is done to positively identify\\nsuspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri-fied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested inincreasing concentrations to determine if it will provokea response. Food testing is much more tedious thaninhalation testing, since full passage through the diges-tive system may take a day or more.Precautions\\nWhile allergy tests are quite safe for most people,\\nthe possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis does\\nexist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous conditionthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop inblood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy-laxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin testsshould never include a substance known to cause ana-phylaxis in the person being tested.\\nProvocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.\\nTherefore, treatment medications should be available fol-lowing the tests, to be administered, if needed.\\nDescription\\nIn prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested\\nis placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergendrops, including a drop of saline solution that should notprovoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista-mine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). Asmall needle is inserted through the drop, and used toprick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick.The sites are examined over the next twenty minutes forevidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positivereaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac-tions may be made by placing paper over the tested area.Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections aremade for each allergen tested. Observations are madeover the next twenty minutes.\\nIn RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in\\nthe laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum isseparated from the blood cells.

Location of allergen-antibody combinations isdone by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so calledanti-antibodies, that are chemically linked with aradioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on thesolid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered.\\nProvocation testing may be performed to identify air-\\nborne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performedonly after a patient’s lung capacity and response to themedium used to dilute the allergen has been determined.Once this has been determined, the patient inhales increas-ingly concentrated samples of a particular allergen, fol-lowed each time by measurement of the exhalation capaci-ty. Only one allergen is tested per day. Testing for foodallergies is usually done by removing the suspect food\\nfrom the diet for two weeks, followed by eating a singleportion of the suspect food and follow-up monitoring.\\nPreparation\\nSkin testing is preceded by a brief examination of\\nthe skin. The patient should refrain from using anti-aller-gy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior toinhalation testing, patients with asthma who can tolerateit may be asked to stop any asthma medications. Testingfor food allergies requires the person to avoid all suspectfood for at least two weeks before testing.\\nAftercare\\nSkin testing does not usually require any aftercare. A\\ngeneralized redness and swelling may occur in the testarea, but it will usually resolve within a day or two.\\nInhalation tests may cause delayed asthma attacks,\\neven if the antigen administered in the test initially pro-duced no response.

Inhalation tests mayprovoke an asthma attack. Exposure to new or unsuspect-ed allergens in any test carries the risk of anaphylaxis.Because patients are monitored following allergy testing,an anaphylactic reaction is usually recognized and treat-ed promptly. Occasionally, a delayed anaphylacticresponse can occur that will require immediate care.Proper patient education regarding how to recognize ana-phylaxis is vital.\\nNormal results\\nLack of redness or swelling on a skin test indicates\\nno allergic response.

Some causes are considered natural, while oth-\\ners signal serious health problems. Some conditions areconfined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughoutthe body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-nents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in thebody.\\nOftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp\\nwill result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific causeis the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-ness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, orhair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is thecondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimesonly the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visiblydiseased as well.Causes and symptoms\\n• Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is consid-\\nered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized bythe distribution of hair loss over the top and front of thehead and by the healthy condition of the scalp.\\n• Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown\\ncause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness.\\n• Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hair\\nloss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’s\\nfootand ringworm , often glows under ultraviolet light.\\n• Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder that\\ncauses a person to pull out his/her own hair.\\n• Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer\\nchemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.Placing a tourniquet around the skull just above the earsduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs mayreduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugsfrom reaching the scalp.\\n• Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec-\\ntively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One exampleis thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism (too much thy-\\nroid hormone) causes hair to become thin and fine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 125Alopecia\\nTop of balding male’s head.

For more obscure diseases, they may have toresort to a skin biopsy , removing a tiny bit of skin using\\na local anesthetic so that it can examined under a micro-scope. Systemic diseases will require a complete evalua-tion by a physician, including specific tests to identifyand characterize the problem.\\nTreatment\\nSuccessful treatment of underlying causes is most\\nlikely to restore hair growth, be it the completion ofchemotherapy, effective cure of a scalp fungus, or controlof a systemic disease. Two relatively new drugs—minox-idil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar)—promote hairgrowth in a significant minority of patients, especiallythose with male pattern baldness and alopecia areata.While both drugs have so far proved to be quite safewhen used for this purpose, minoxidil is a liquid that is\\napplied to the scalp and finasteride is the first and onlyapproved treatment in a pill form.\\nMinoxidil was approved for over-the-counter sales\\nin 1996.

There is also anover-the-counter extra-strength version of minoxidil (5%concentration) approved for use by men only. The treat-ment often results in new hair that is thinner and lighterin color. It is important to note that new hair stops grow-ing soon after the use of minoxidil is discontinued.\\nOver the past few decades there have appeared a\\nmultitude of hair replacement methods performed byboth physicians and non-physicians. They range fromsimply weaving someone else’s hair in with the remainsof your own to surgically transplanting thousands of hairfollicles one at a time.\\nHair transplantation is completed by taking tiny\\nplugs of skin, each containing one to several hairs,from the back side of the scalp. The bald sections arethen implanted with the plugs. Research completed in2000 looked at the new technique of hair grafting, andfound that micrografts (one to two hairs transplantedper follicle) resulted in fewer complications and thebest results\\nAnother surgical procedure used to treat androgenic\\nalopecia is scalp reduction. By stretching skin the hair-less scalp can be removed and the area of bald skindecreased by closing the space with hair-covered scalp.Hair-bearing skin can also be folded over an area of baldskin with a technique called a flap.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis varies with the cause. It is generally\\nmuch easier to lose hair than to regrow it. Even when itreturns, it is often thin and less attractive than the original.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc.

This screening test mea-\\nsures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi-cates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri-ous birth defects . The level of AFP can also be deter-\\nmined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. Thisscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; itonly indicates the increase of risk for several birthdefects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detectliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitorthe progress of cancer treatment.\\nPurpose\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the\\nliver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein isunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producingAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine andsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enterthe mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-mined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. Byanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-otic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probabilitythat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is veryimportant that the doctor know precisely how old thefetus is when the test is performed since the AFP levelchanges over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFPscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test isused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate lineof testing (like amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows,\\nbased on the results.\\nAbnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus\\nhas an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the mostcommon and severe type of disorder associated withincreased AFP. These types of defects include spinalcolumn defects ( spina bifida ) and anencephaly (a\\nsevere and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tubethat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not closecorrectly during fetal development, AFP may leakthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amnioticfluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels ofAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If thescreening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-sound is used to diagnosis the problem.\\nOther fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels\\nabove normal include:\\n• cysts at the end of the spine• blockage in the esophagus or intestines\\n• liver disease causing liver cells to die\\n• defects in the abdominal wall• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease\\n• brittle bone disease\\nLevels may also be high if there is too little fluid in\\nthe amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-oping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along thanestimated.\\nFor unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may\\nindicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down\\nsyndrome . Down syndrome is a condition that\\nincludes mental retardation and a distinctive physical\\nappearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicatesan abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-nosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP canalso occur when the fetus has died or when the motheris overweight.\\nAFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that\\nanalyzes three substances as risk indicators of possiblebirth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionicgonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea-sured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the testresults increases.\\nAlthough AFP in human blood gradually disappears\\nafter birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear inliver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.The AFP test is used to screen people at high risk forthese conditions. After a cancerous tumor is removed, an\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 127Alpha-fetoprotein testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 127', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 121}), Document(page_content='AFP test can monitor the progress of treatment. Contin-\\nued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is very important that the doctor know precisely\\nhow old the fetus is when the test is performed since theAFP level considered normal changes over the length ofthe pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetuslead to errors when interpreting the test results. Since anAFP test is only a screening tool, more specific testsmust follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormaltest result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has abirth defect. The test has a high rate of abnormal results(either high or low) in order to prevent missing a fetusthat has a serious condition.\\nDescription\\nThe AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of\\npregnancy. Blood is drawn from a vein, usually on theinside of the elbow. AFP can also be measured in the sam-ple of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis.Test results are usually available after about one week.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no specific physical preparation for the AFP\\ntest.\\nAftercare\\nThere is no specific aftercare involved with this\\nscreening test.\\nRisks\\nThe risks associated with drawing blood are mini-\\nmal, but may include bleeding from the puncture site,feeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is drawn, orblood accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma).\\nNormal results\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms per\\nmilliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability. TheKEY TERMS\\nAmniotic fluid —Fluid within the uterine sac in\\nwhich the fetus lives until born.\\nFetus —The stage in human development from the\\nsecond month of pregnancy until birth.probability (1:100, for example) translates into the\\nchance that the fetus has a defect (a one in 100 chance,for example).\\nWhen testing for cancer or liver diseases, AFP\\nresults are reported as nanograms per milliliter. An AFPlevel less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered nor-mal.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe doctor will inform the woman of her specific\\nincreased risk as compared to the “normal” risk of a stan-dard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater thanthe standard risk for women who are 35 years old orolder (one in 270), then amniocentesis is recommended.Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormalAFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that hasDown’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts risk;appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an abnor-mal screening result.\\nIn tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP level\\ngreater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCunningham, Gary, et al.

This causes vasodilation and allowsblood to flow more easily.\\nPurpose\\nThese drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are\\nused for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure(hypertension ) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia\\n(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterizedby an enlarged prostate gland.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and\\nthe arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage theblood vessels to the point of causing stroke ,heart fail-\\nureor kidney failure. People with high blood pressure\\nmay also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controllinghigh blood pressure makes these problems less likely.Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causingvasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of theblood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily.\\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\\nThis condition particularly affects older men. Over\\ntime, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad-der, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere withthe passage of urine from the bladder out of the body.Men who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinatemore often. Or they may feel that they can not complete-ly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con-traction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus-cles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine toflow more freely.\\nDescription\\nCommonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten-\\nsion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin(Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also usedin the treatment of heart failure. All are available onlywith a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose depends on the patient and\\nthe type of alpha blocker and may change over the courseof treatment. The prescribing physician will graduallyincrease the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may needas much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per dayof doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin,but most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosageincreases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects.\\nAlpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed,\\neven if the medication does not seem to be working atfirst. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improvebecause it needs to be taken regularly to be effective.Patients should avoid missing any doses, and should nottake larger or more frequent doses to make up formissed doses.\\nPrecautions\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a\\ngreater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness ,\\nlightheadedness, heart palpitations , and fainting . Activ-\\nities such as driving, using machines, or doing anythingelse that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking thefirst dose should be avoided. Patients should be remindedto be especially careful not to fall when getting up in themiddle of the night. The same precautions are recom-mended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has beenstopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety onthe job could be affected by taking alpha blockers shouldinform his or her physician, so that the physician cantake this factor into account when increasing dosage.\\nDizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like-\\nly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drinkalcohol, exercise , stand for a long time, or are exposed to\\nhot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi-tions and alcohol consumption should be limited.\\nSome people may feel drowsy or less alert when\\nusing these drugs. They should accordingly avoid drivingor performing activities that require full attention.\\nPeople diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease\\nmay also be more sensitive to alpha blockers. They shouldinform their physicians about these conditions if alphablockers are prescribed. Older people may also be moresensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted sideeffects, such as fainting, dizziness, and lightheadedness.\\nIt should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure\\nhigh blood pressure. They simply help to keep the condi-tion under control. Similarly, these drugs will not shrinkan enlarged prostate gland. Although they will helprelieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, theprostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may benecessary to have prostate surgery.\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood counts.

All varieties of the syndromeare characterized by kidney disease that usually pro-gresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia (the\\npresence of excessive amounts of urea and other wasteproducts in the blood).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defect\\nin one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It isusually inherited from the mother, who is a normal carri-er. However, in up to 20% of cases there is no family his-tory of the disorder. In these cases, there appears to be aspontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome.\\nBlood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of\\nAlport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear invarying combinations include:\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)• sensorineural hearing loss• eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements\\n(nystagmus ),cataracts , or cornea problems]\\n• skin problems• platelet disorders• abnormal white blood cells• smooth muscle tumorsKEY TERMS\\nAlbumin —A protein that is important in maintain-\\ning blood volume.

High altitude is defined asheight greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitudeis defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined asheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majorityof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness whenthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% ofpeople ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one daywill develop altitude sickness. Children under six yearsand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles maybe more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medicalconditions—even a minor respiratory infection—maybecome sick at more moderate altitudes.\\nDescription\\nThere are three major clinical syndromes that fall\\nunder the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountainsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema\\n(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).\\nThese syndromes are not separate, individual syndromesas much as they are a continuum of severity, all resultingfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,and the other two represent severe, life-threatening formsof altitude sickness.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 132Altitude sicknessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 126}), Document(page_content='Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure\\nof oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is aterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the termconcentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygendrops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, thereis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for theindividual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-more, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygenreaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These twoconditions are the major factors that form the basis for allthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness.\\nAs a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural\\nresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). Thisis the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapidrate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxiaat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and itoccurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is aresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lowerto higher altitudes. There are groups of people who havelived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayanand Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-ply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhapsthrough a genetic ability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of\\naltitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes highergreater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981m) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia isassociated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-anism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-firmed. It is important to realize that some individualsacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer fromAMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibilityof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-not be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer fromAMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the secondor third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usuallyabates after three to five days if they remain at the samealtitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel toan even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a fewhours to a few days following ascent, and they includedizziness ,headache ,shortness of breath , nausea, vomit-\\ning, loss of appetite, and insomnia .\\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-\\nthreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage ofthose who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaksfrom within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lungtissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lungtissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins toKEY TERMS\\nCerebral —Pertaining to the brain.\\nEdema —Accumulation of excess fluid in the tis-\\nsues of the body.\\nHypoxemia —Insufficient oxygenation of the blood.\\nHypoxia —A deficiency in the amount of oxygen\\nrequired for effective ventilation.\\nPulmonary —Pertaining to the lungs.\\nbecome more and more short of breath. HAPE is known\\nto afflict all types of individuals, regardless of their levelof physical fitness.\\nTypically, the individual who suffers from HAPE\\nascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate-ly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, acough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody\\nsputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis-tance is provided by this point, the patient goes into acoma and dies within a few hours.\\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest and\\nmost severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebraledema, and its mechanism of development is also poorlyunderstood. The symptoms often begin with those ofAMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered levelof consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache,loss of coordination, hallucinations , and even seizures.\\nIf no intervention is implemented, death is the result.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made\\nfrom the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur-ing travel to higher altitudes.\\nTreatment\\nMild AMS requires no treatment other than an\\naspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur-\\nther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because theymay blunt the respiratory response, making it even moredifficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidlyenough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen inthe environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviatesymptoms of mild AMS.\\nAs for HAPE and HACE, the most important course\\nof action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi-ble.

If descent is not\\npossible, oxygen therapy should be started. In addition,dexamethasone (a steroid) has been suggested in order toreduce cerebral edema.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriate\\nmeasures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE, the prog-nosis depends upon the rapidity and distance of descentand the availability of medical intervention. Descentoften leads to improvement of symptoms, however,recovery times vary among individuals.\\nPrevention\\nWhen individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom-\\nmended that they spend at least one night at an interme-diate altitude prior to ascending to higher elevations. Ingeneral, climbers should take at least two days to gofrom sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438 m). After reachingthat point, healthy climbers should generally allow oneday for each additional 2,000 feet (610 m), and one dayof rest should be taken every two or three days. Shouldmild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should beavoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individualshould return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicatethat acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken beforeascent as a preventative measure for AMS.\\nPaying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-\\ntude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes,so climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro-duce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clearurine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should beavoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydratesnacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods) canhelp, especially in the first few days of climbing.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCrystal, R. G., ed., et al.

AD usually occurs in old age, andis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such asremembering, reasoning, and planning.\\nDescription\\nA person with AD usually has a gradual decline in\\nmental functions, often beginning with slight memoryloss, followed by losses in the ability to maintainemployment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and toreason and exercise judgment. Communication ability,\\nmood, and personality may also be affected. Most peoplewho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,although that interval may be as short as one year or aslong as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death\\nin adults after heart disease, cancer , and stroke .\\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD;\\nthat number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million bythe middle of the 21st century as the population as a wholeages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50sdevelop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-nantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all peoplebetween ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly morewomen than men are affected with AD, but this may bebecause women tend to live longer, and so there is a higherproportion of women in the most affected age groups.\\nThe costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-\\nerable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient withmild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual directand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the UnitedStates was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.Slightly more than half of AD patients are cared for athome, while the remainder are cared for in a variety ofhealth care institutions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are\\nunknown. Some strong leads have been found throughrecent research, however, and these have also given sometheoretical support to several new experimental treatments.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 134Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 128}), Document(page_content='At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts of\\nthe brain that control memory, including the hippocam-pus, which is a structure deep in the deep that controlsshort-term memory. As these neurons in the hippocampusstop functioning, the short-term memory of the personfails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.Later AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areasresponsible for language and reasoning; this languageskills are lost and the ability to make judgments ischanged. Personality changes occur, which may includeemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-ity of these changes increases with the progression of thedisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain becomeinvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink andlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.\\nAutopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions\\nof the brain affected by the disease become clogged withtwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tanglesand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twistedmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. InAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilizeparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twistedand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein calledamyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spacesbetween the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clearexactly how these structures cause problems, manyresearchers believe that their formation is responsible forthe mental changes of AD, presumably by interferingwith the normal communication between neurons in thebrain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms havebeen approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). They act by increasing the level ofchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks downacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released byneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. Thesedrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’sability to perform normal activities of daily living.\\nWhat triggers the formation of plaques and tangles\\nand the development of AD are unknown. AD likelyresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,environmental, and others not yet identified. Two typesof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, withno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described interms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring inpeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those\\n65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 ofAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some casesof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in somefamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than themore common late-on-set type.\\nAll FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have\\nbeen identified so far are the early on-set type. As manyas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by threegenes located on three different chromosomes. Somefamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormalAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes theproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and othershave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymesthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be importantin the synaptic connections between brain cells.\\nThere is no evidence that the mutated genes that\\ncause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, butgenetics does appear to play a role in this more commonform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most importantgenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene onthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codesfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), calledAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inheritsone APOE from each parent, and therefore can eitherhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies ofone. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect somepeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with alower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD doesdevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found inthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increasethe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritanceof one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to thosewithout APOE e4, people with one copy are about threetimes as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those withtwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as muchas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk ofdeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyonewith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it canstill have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases thechances of developing AD is not known with certainty.However, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-amyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-ering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involveinteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 135Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 135', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 129}), Document(page_content='cell death independent of its effects on plaque buildup. In\\n2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genomewere identified, where one out of several hundred genesin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to makea contribution to the risk of developing late-onset ADthat is at least as important as APOE e4.\\nOther non-genetic factors have also been studied in\\nrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brainmay play a role in development of AD, and use of nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to\\nreduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of bloodflow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting forthe beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases bloodflow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactivemolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells ofall kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-plies of protective antioxidants thought to protect againstfree radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,and its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.\\nWhile the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease are still unknown, there are several risk factorsthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-ease. The most significant one is, of course, age; olderpeople develop AD at much higher rates than youngerones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may belinked, with small strokes that go undetected clinicallycontributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterollevels may also be important. Scientists have shown thathigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-cally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rateof plaque deposition. There are also parallels betweenAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disordersthat cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-son’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.\\nNumerous epidemiological studies of populations are\\nalso being conducted to learn more about whether and towhat extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, andethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. Forexample, results from one study indicated that rural resi-dence in childhood, along with fewer than six years ofschooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-ever, the low educational attainment that was identified asa risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-terious socioeconomic or environmental influences inchildhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpretingepidemiological findings, due to the complexity of theissues and the large number of variables involved.\\nMany environmental factors have been suspected of\\ncontributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-ies have not borne out these links. Among these havebeen pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-mercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none\\nof these factors has been shown to cause AD or increaseits likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links toother environmental factors.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-\\nally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memorylapses are of course common to everyone, and do not bythemselves signify any change in cognitive function. Theperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort ofmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—butprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such asforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becominglost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhoodbecomes more likely as the disease progresses. A personwith AD may forget the names of family members, orforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence bythe time he hears the end.\\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-\\ning inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,and personality or behavior changes. Some patients havetrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-tion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-drome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the sameideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior knownas perseveration. In the final stages people may havesevere problems with eating, communicating, and con-trolling their bladder and bowel functions.\\nThe Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten\\nwarning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-toms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:\\n• memory loss that affects job skills\\n• difficulty performing familiar tasks• problems with language\\n• disorientation of time and place\\n• poor or decreased judgment• problems with abstract thinking\\n• misplacing things\\n• changes in mood or behavior\\n• changes in personality\\n• loss of initiative\\nOther types of dementia, including some that are\\nreversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important forthe person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro-fessional who can weigh the possibility that his or hersymptoms may have another cause. Approximately 20% ofthose originally suspected of having AD turn out to havesome other disorder; about half of these cases are treatable.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 136Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 136', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 130}), Document(page_content='Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and\\nmay require office visits to several different specialistsover several months before a diagnosis can be made.While a confident provisional diagnosis may be made inmost cases after thorough testing, AD cannot be defini-tively diagnosed until autopsy examination of the brainfor plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\\nThe diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi-\\ncal exam and complete medical history. Except in thedisease’s earliest stages, accurate history from familymembers or caregivers is essential. Since there are bothprescription and over-the-counter drugs that can causethe same mental changes as AD, a careful review of thepatient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important.AD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-ical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen-tia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia).These possibilities must be ruled out as well throughappropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography\\n(PET ) or single photon emission computed tomography\\n(SPECT) scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity(electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Severaltypes of oral and written tests are used to aid in the ADdiagnosis and to follow its progression, including tests ofmental status, functional abilities, memory, and concen-tration. Still, the neurologic exam is normal in most\\npatients in early stages.\\nOne of the most important parts of the diagnostic\\nprocess is to evaluate the patient for depression anddelirium , since each of these can be present with AD,\\nor may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves adecreased consciousness or awareness of one’s environ-ment.) Depression and memory loss are both commonin the elderly, and the combination of the two can oftenbe mistaken for AD. Depression can be treated withdrugs, although some antidepressants can worsendementia if it is present, further complicating both diag-nosis and treatment.\\nAn early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important\\nin developing strategies for managing symptoms and forhelping patients and their families planning for the futureand pursuing care options while the patient can still takepart in the decision-making process.\\nA genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available, but\\nis not used for diagnosis, since possessing even twocopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD. Inaddition, access to genetic information could affect theinsurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affectemployment status and legal rights.Treatment\\nAlzheimer’s disease is presently incurable, so there-\\nfore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD isgood nursing care, providing both physical and emotion-al support for a person who is gradually able to do lessand less for himself, and whose behavior is becomingmore and more erratic. Modifications of the home toincrease safety and security are often necessary. Thecaregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair,and burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becomingfamiliar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider-ing the appropriate financial and legal issues early on,can help both the patient and family cope with the diffi-cult process of the disease. Regular medical care by apractitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD isimportant so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratoryinfections can be diagnosed and treated properly, ratherthan being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable declineseen in AD.\\nPeople with AD are also often depressed or anxious,\\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition , and\\ngeneral poor health. Each of these conditions is treatableto some degree. It is important for the person with AD toeat well and continue to exercise. Professional advicefrom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy,easy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable tothose requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise(supervised if necessary for safety) promotes overallhealth. A calm, structured environment with simple ori-entation aids (such as calendars and clocks) may reduceanxiety and increase safety. Other psychiatric symptoms,\\nsuch as depression, anxiety, hallucinations (seeing or\\nhearing things that aren’t there), and delusions (false\\nbeliefs) may be treated with drugs if necessary.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 137Alzheimer’s disease\\nDiseased tissue from the brain of an Alzheimer’s patient\\nshowing senile plaques within the brain’s gray matter.

Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improv-ing memory skills, but only in patients with mild-to-mod-erate AD, and even then in less than half of those who takeit. Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, butit may delay the need for nursing home admission. Themost significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzymeknown as alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients tak-ing tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor theirALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,vomiting, diarrhea , abdominal pain ,indigestion , and\\nskin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month inearly 1998, with additional costs for the weekly bloodmonitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to becost-effective for those who respond to it, since it maydecrease the number of months a patient needs nursingcare. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treatmild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helpssome patients for periods of time ranging from months toabout two years. Donepezil has two advantages overtacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given oncedaily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does notappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does notrequire weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominalside effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi-mately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in Aprilof 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patientsto carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing,decrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi-tation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking,memory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of theother two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stopsor reverses the progression of AD.\\nEstrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-\\nscribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo-\\nporosis . Several preliminary studies have shown that\\nwomen taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and thosewho develop AD have a slower progression and lesssevere symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear tohave a beneficial effect on women who already have AD.\\nPreliminary studies have also suggested a reduced\\nrisk for developing AD in older people who regularly usenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-ing aspirin , ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta-\\nminophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char-acteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect ofthe disease is not yet known.\\nAntioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect\\nagainst oxidative damage caused by free radicals, havebeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis-\\nsue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to seewhether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.\\nAnother antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought to\\ndelay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due tothe specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to anincrease in the overall health of those taking it.\\nDrugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and\\nsedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms(agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders )\\nof AD. Research is being conducted to search for bettertreatments, including non-drug approaches for ADpatients.\\nNursing care and safety\\nThe person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually\\nlose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use thetoilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, hemay be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per-son’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency towander may make it difficult to leave him unattended foreven a few minutes and make even the home a potentiallydangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibitinappropriate sexual behaviors.\\nThe nursing care required for a person with AD is\\nwell within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif-ficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant butunpredictable nature of the demands put on them. Inaddition, the personality changes undergone by a personwith AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as aloved one deteriorates, seeming to become a differentperson. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors:some become quite gentle, and spend increasing amountsof time in dreamlike states.\\nA loss of good grooming may be one of the early\\nsymptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,and decreased interest in personal hygiene become morecommon. Caregivers, especially spouses, may find thesechanges socially embarrassing and difficult to cope with.The caregiver will usually need to spend increasingamounts of time for grooming to compensate for the lossof attention from the patient, although some adjustmentof expectations (while maintaining cleanliness) is oftenneeded as the disease progresses.\\nProper nutrition is important for a person with AD,\\nand may require assisted feeding early on, to make sure theperson is taking in enough nutrients. Later on, as move-ment and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube maybe placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Afeeding tube requires more attention, but is generally easyto care for if the patient is not resistant to its use.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 138Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 138', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 132}), Document(page_content='For many caregivers, incontinence becomes the\\nmost difficult problem to deal with at home, and is aprincipal reason for pursuing nursing home care.

Inall cases, a person diagnosed with AD should no longerbe allowed to drive, because of the increased potentialfor accidents and the increased likelihood of wanderingvery far from home while disoriented. In the home, sim-ple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed railson the bed, and easily negotiable passageways can great-ly increase safety. Electrical appliances should beunplugged and put away when not in use, and matches,lighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely outof reach. The hot water heater temperature may be setlower to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergencynumbers, including the poison control center and thehospital emergency room, should be posted by thephone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to peri-odically reevaluate the physical safety of the home andintroduce new strategies for continued safety.\\nCare for the caregiver\\nFamily members or others caring for a person with\\nAD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, whichbecomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementiacaregivers spend significantly more time on caregivingthan do people providing care for those with other typesof illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a greaterimpact in terms of employment complications, caregiverstrain, mental and physical health problems, time forleisure and other family members, and family conflictthan do other types of caregiving. It is common for ADcaregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel fortheir loved one and for themselves. Depression is anextremely common consequence of being a full-timecaregiver for a person with AD. Support groups are animportant way to deal with the stress of caregiving.\\nBecoming a member of an AD caregivers’ support groupcan be one of the most important things a family memberdoes, not only for him or herself, but for the person withAD as well. The location and contact numbers for ADcaregiver support groups are available from theAlzheimer’s Association; they may also be availablethrough a local social service agency, the patient’s physi-cian, or pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the\\ndrugs used to treat AD. Medical treatment for depressionmay be an important adjunct to group support.\\nOutside help, nursing homes, and governmental\\nassistance\\nMost families eventually need outside help to relieve\\nsome of the burden of around-the-clock care for a personwith AD. Personal care assistants, either volunteer orpaid, may be available through local social service agen-cies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasinglycommon. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respitecare may be available as well.\\nProviding the total care required by a person with\\nlate-stage AD can become an overwhelming burden for afamily, even with outside help. At this stage, many fami-lies consider nursing home care. This decision is often oneof the most difficult for the family, since it is often seen asan abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the fami-ly. Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician, cler-gy, or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of thistransition. Selecting a nursing home may require a difficultbalancing of cost, services, location, and availability.Keeping the entire family involved in the decision mayhelp prevent further stress from developing later on.\\nSeveral federal government programs may ease the\\ncost of caring for a person with AD, including SocialSecurity Disability, Medicare, and Supplemental Securi-ty Income. Each of these programs may provide someassistance for care, medication, or other costs, but noneof them will pay for nursing home care indefinitely.Medicaid is a state-funded program that may provide forsome or all of the cost of nursing home care, althoughthere are important restrictions. Details of the benefitsand eligibility requirements of these programs are avail-able through the local Social Security or Medicaid office,or from local social service agencies.\\nPrivate long-term care insurance, special “reverse\\nmortgages,” viatical insurance, and other financial devicesare other ways of paying for care for those with the appro-priate financial situations.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaningthat when a decrease in vision is detected, other causesmust be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly-opia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two linesor more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) betweenthe two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worsewould be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someonehas 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 withthe left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision withcorrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic.\\nDescription\\nLazy eye is a common non-medical term used to\\ndescribe amblyopia because the eye with poorer visiondoesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia isthe most common cause of impaired vision in children,affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%of the population. Vision is a combination of the clarityof the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-ing of those images by the brain. If the images producedby the two eyes are substantially different, the brain maynot be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-ferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-presses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead toamblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferringone eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-ment in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:•Strabismus . A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is\\nthe most common cause of functional amblyopia. Thetwo eyes are looking in two different directions at thesame time. The brain is sent two different images andthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\\n• Anisometropia. This is another type of functional\\namblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-tive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-ference of prescriptions between the two eyes). Forexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than theother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the othereye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the twodissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrierimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\\n• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the\\nimage to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataractmay become amblyopic.\\n•Ptosis . This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light\\ncannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, theeye is essentially not being used. This can lead toamblyopia.\\n•Nutrition . A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri-\\ntional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result inamblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency in the Bvitamins may result in toxic amblyopia.\\n• Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.\\nBarring the presence of strabismus or ptosis, chil-\\ndren may or may not show signs of amblyopia. Childrenmay hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor theeye with normal vision. They may have trouble seeing orreaching for things when approached from the side of theamblyopic eye.

If an infant’s\\ngood eye is covered, the child may cry.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause children with outwardly normal eyes may\\nhave amblyopia, it is important to have regular visionscreenings performed for all children. While there issome controversy regarding the age children should havetheir first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality,be examined at any age, even at one day of life.\\nSome recommend that children have their vision\\nchecked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal-mologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age.Others recommend testing by at least the child’s fourthbirthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop-ment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable afterage eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the betterthe possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part ofa child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eyeproblem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.\\nThere are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to\\nmeasure the refractive status of the eyes. This can helpdetermine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-heldinstrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (orinfant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip-tion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determinedusing a variety of methods. Many different eye charts areavailable (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters). In ambly-opia, single letters are easier to recognize than when aKEY TERMS\\nAnisometropia —An eye condition in which there\\nis an inequality of vision between the two eyes.There may be unequal amounts of nearsighted-ness, farsightedness, or astigmatism, so that oneeye will be in focus while the other will not.\\nCataract —Cloudiness of the eye’s natural lens.\\nOcculsion therapy —A type of treatment for ambly-\\nopia in which the good eye is patched for a periodof time.

Neutral density filtersmay also be held over the eye to aid in the diagnosis.Sometimes visual fields to determine defects in the areaof vision will be performed. Color vision testing may alsobe performed. Again, it must be emphasized that ambly-opia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threateningproblems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exami-nation of the eyes and visual system is very importantwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion\\ntherapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopiceye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too maybecome amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment planshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understandhow long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-es may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focusand work. This is called vision therapy or vision training\\n(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in theweak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-od of years to maintain the improvement.\\nWhile patching is necessary to get the amblyopic\\neye to work, it is just as important to correct the reasonfor the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there areerrors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may benecessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition isindicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,amblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the goodeye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use theamblyopic eye.\\nPrognosis\\nThe younger the person, the better the chance for\\nimprovement with occlusion and vision therapy. Howev-er, treatment may be successful in older children—evenadults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia alsodepends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specifictype of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor-tant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig-nificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The bestoutcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.\\nPrevention\\nTo protect their child’s vision, parents must be aware\\nof amblyopia as a potential problem. This awareness mayencourage parents to take young children for vision examsearly on in life—certainly before school age.

Persons with amebiasis may experi-\\nence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea ,\\nfever , and cramps. The disease may also affect the\\nintestines, liver, or other parts of the body.\\nDescription\\nAmebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one\\nof the most common parasitic diseases occurring inhumans, with an estimated 500 million new cases eachyear. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropicalareas where living conditions are crowded, with inade-quate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occurin persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit anysymptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 peopledie of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia-sis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrantworkers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrantsdevelop amebiasis at a higher rate.\\nHuman beings are the only known host of the amebi-\\nasis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of ageor sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarilyspread in food and water that has been contaminated byhuman feces but is also spread by person-to-person con-tact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region-al outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces areused as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup-plies contaminated with human feces.Causes and symptoms\\nRecently, it has been discovered that persons with\\nsymptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe-\\nba histolytica , and those individuals who exhibit no\\nsymptoms are actually infected with an almost identical-looking ameba called Entamoeba dispar . During their\\nlife cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms:the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot movebut can survive outside the human body because of itsprotective covering, and the disease-producing form, thetrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannotinfect others. The disease is most commonly transmittedwhen a person eats food or drinks water containing E.\\nhistolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract\\nthe cysts are transported to the intestine where the wallsof the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions,releasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released withinthe intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding onintestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the largeintestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, thetrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinaltissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer).The trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in theintestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal walland be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, orother organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestineseventually form new cysts that are carried through thedigestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorabletemperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can sur-vive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to beginthe cycle again.\\nAlthough 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United\\nStates are mild, pregnant women, children under twoyears of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 143Amebiasis\\nA micrograph of Entameoba histolytica, a parasitic amoeba\\nwhich invades and destroys the tissues of the intestines,causing amebiasis and ulceration to the intestinal wall.(Photo Researchers, Inc.

Most persons with\\namebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even thoughthese individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable ofinfecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta-minating food or water with cysts that others may ingest,for example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.\\nCHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu-\\nals may experience symptoms over a long period of timeduring a chronic amebiasis infection and experiencerecurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to fourweeks and recur over a period of years. These patientsmay also suffer from abdominal cramps, fatigue , and\\nweight loss.\\nAMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal\\namebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes-tine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severeabdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame-bic dysentery may cause complications, includinginflammation of the appendix ( appendicitis ), a tear in\\nthe intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severeinflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis).\\nAMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the\\nbowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It canresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acuteamebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptomsthat mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.\\nPERIANAL ULCERS. Intestinal amebiasis may pro-\\nduce skin infections in the area around the patient’s anus(perianal). These ulcerated areas have a “punched-out”appearance and are painful to the touch.\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate-\\nly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes allforms of the disease that affect other organs.\\nThe most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis\\nis amebic abscess of the liver. In the United States, ame-bic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His-\\npanic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result fromdirect infection of the liver by E. histolytica or as a com-\\nplication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebicabscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest or\\nabdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right sidedirectly above the liver.\\nOther forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though\\nrare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain,or genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela-tively high mortality rate.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly\\nbecause the disease can affect several areas of the bodyand can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms tobeing severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, aphysician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when apatient has a combination of symptoms, in particular,diarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure toamebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons,or anal intercourse.\\nIt is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and\\nanother disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) thatproduces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor-rectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage thegrowth and spread of the amebiasis organism.

Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having aperiod by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is morecommon and refers to either the temporary or permanentending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor-mally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional-ly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or moreperiods in a row.\\nDescription\\nThe absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, not\\na disease. While the average age that menstruation beginsis 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor-rhea in the United States is just 2.5%.\\nSome female athletes who participate in rowing,\\nlong distance running, and cycling, may notice a fewmissed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk fordeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts,who typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor-\\nrhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi-atric disorders, eating disorders, malnutrition , excessive\\nthinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content toolow, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physicaltraining prior to puberty can delay menarche (the onset\\nof menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar-che for up to five months. Some medications such as anti-depressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induceamenorrhea.\\nPrimary amenorrhea\\nHowever, the main cause is a delay in the beginning\\nof puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity orpoor nutrition ) or because of a problem in the endocrine\\nsystem, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism . An\\nobstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus maybe the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic,endocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder.\\nTypical causes of primary amenorrhea include:\\n• excessive physical activity• drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or\\nbulimia)\\n• extreme obesity\\n• drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)\\n• chronic illness\\n• turner’s syndrome.

In adolescents, pregnancy and\\nstress are two major causes. Missed periods are usually\\ncaused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ-ment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri-ods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, orincreased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces-sation of periods for four months should be evaluated.\\nThe most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is\\npregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarilyafter she stops taking birth control pills. This temporaryhalt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in somecases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor-rhea may also be related to hormonal problems related tostress, depression, anorexia nervosa or drugs, or it may\\nbe caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as atumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma-nently after menopause or a hysterectomy .\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome is another common cause\\nof secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain-ing many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels ofmale hormones (androgens). This condition is related toimproper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releaseshormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor-mones), and can cause women to develop male characteris-tics, such as acne and coarse body hair. If the condition is\\nnot treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen,and chronically high levels of estrogen may increase thechance of developing cancer of the uterine lining.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea,\\nbut the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan-cy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period istwo to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogendeficiency, or other problems with the endocrine systemneed to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy-roid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked.\\nThe diagnosis usually includes a patient history and\\na physical exam (including a pelvic exam ). If a woman\\nhas missed three or more periods in a row, a physicianmay recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels,a scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitarytumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis torule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary.Treatment\\nTreatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri-\\nmary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’salways important to discover the cause of the problem inany case. Not all conditions can be treated, but anyunderlying condition that is treatable should be treated.\\nIf a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges-\\nterone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor-rect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birthcontrol pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor istreated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certainhormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bringon a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessiveexercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods inteen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be neededfor women with ovarian or uterine cysts.\\nPrognosis\\nProlonged amenorrhea can lead to infertility and other\\nmedical problems such as osteoporosis (thinning of the\\nbones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stressor illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass-es or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis-continuing birth control pills usually go away within six toeight weeks, although it may take up to a year.\\nThe prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends\\non the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan.Spironolactone, a drug that blocks the production ofmale hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If awoman wishes to become pregnant, treatment withclomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions,surgery on the ovaries.\\nPrevention\\nPrimary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi-\\ntion cannot be prevented. In general, however, womenshould maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise,rest, and not too much stress, avoiding smoking and sub-\\nstance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a bal-anced diet and rest and exercise normally. However,many cases of amenorrhea cannot be prevented.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarlson, Karen J., Stephanie Eisenstat, and Ziporyn Eisenstat.\\nThe Harvard Guide to Women’s Health.

All of thesedrugs have the same basic chemical structure.\\nPurpose\\nAminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec-\\ntions due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. These bacte-ria can be identified by their reaction to Gram’s stain. InGram’s staining, a film of material containing the possiblebacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried. The slide isstained with crystal violet for one minute, cleaned off withwater and then placed into a solution of Gram’s iodinesolution for one minute. The iodine solution is rinsed offand the slide is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide isthen stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safraninefor 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined. Gram-positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain. Gram-nega-tive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success-fully be combated with aminoglycosides includePseudomonas ,Acinetobacter , and Enterobacter species,\\namong others. Aminoglycosides are also effective againstmycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis .\\nThe aminoglycosides can be used against certain\\nGram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employedbecause other antibiotics are more effective and havefewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffectiveagainst anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow inthe presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And onlyone aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para-sitic infection.\\nLike all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not\\neffective against influenza , the common cold , or other\\nviral infections.\\nPrecautions\\nPre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis-\\nease, eighth cranial nerve disease, myasthenia gravis , and\\nParkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to takingany aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advisedagainst taking aminoglycosides, because their infants maysuffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal-ance. However, those factors need to be considered along-side the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases ofserious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breastmilk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre-scribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants.\\nDescription\\nStreptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolated\\nfrom Streptomyces griseus in the mid-1940s. This antibiot-ic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the main\\ndrawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cellsin the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore,some strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment withstreptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con-siderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep-tomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.\\nAminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the\\ngastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral-ly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished inquantity. The route of drug administration depends on thetype and location of the infection being treated. The typi-cal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec-tion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection intoa vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.If the infection being treated involves the central nervoussystem, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal.\\nThe bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not\\nbeen fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches toa bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan-nels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell,the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes.Ribosomes are the intracellular structures responsible formanufacturing proteins. This attachment either shutsdown protein production or causes the cell to produceabnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannotsurvive with this impediment.\\nAntibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may\\npair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually abeta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately.Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cellwall, making it more porous. The increased porosityallows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell.\\nTraditionally, aminoglycosides were administered at\\neven doses given throughout the day. It was thought thata steady plasma concentration was necessary to combatinfection. However, this administration schedule is timeand labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a singledaily dose can be as effective, or more effective, thanseveral doses throughout the day.\\nDosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender,\\nand general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid-neys, it is important to assess any underlying problemswith kidney function. Kidney function is assessed bymeasuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor-mally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is anindication that the kidneys may not be functioning at anoptimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly.\\nRisks\\nAminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer-\\ntain cells in the ears and in the kidneys.

They may even be awarethat they suffer from a memory disorder.\\nPeople who experience amnesia have been instrumen-\\ntal in helping brain researchers determine how the brainprocesses memory. Until the early 1970s, researchersviewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-ences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioningwere grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-cific area of the brain.\\nIf all memory were stored in the same way, it would\\nbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brainarea would cause complete memory loss. However, stud-ies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such researchdemonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro-cessing, storing, and drawing on memory.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable\\nto brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec-tion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow to\\nthe brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoffsyndrome, for example, damage to the memory centersof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-\\ntion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including\\nencephalitis and herpes, can also cause amnesia. If the\\namnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it istermed psychogenic.\\nThere are at least three general types of amnesia:\\n• Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-\\nma and is characterized by the inability to remembernew information. Recent experiences and short-termmemory disappear, but victims can recall events priorto the trauma with clarity.\\n• Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is the\\nopposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recallevents that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem-ber previously familiar information or the events pre-ceding the trauma.\\n• Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no\\nconsistently identifiable cause, but researchers havesuggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacksmay be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack ,\\nsometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when ablockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-ply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences suddenconfusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severeattacks, a person is completely disoriented and mayexperience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever-al years. While very frightening for the patient, tran-sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-sis for recovery.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look at\\nseveral factors. During a physical examination , the doc-\\ntor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug andmedication history, and checks the patient’s generalhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-mine the extent of amnesia and the memory systemaffected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such asmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal whether\\nthe brain has been damaged, and blood work to excludetreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the root cause of amnesia and\\nis handled on an individual basis. Regardless of cause,cognitive rehabilitation may be helpful in learning\\nstrategies to cope with memory impairment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 152Amnesia\\nAmygdalaHippocampus\\nMemory loss may result from bilateral damage to the limbic\\nsystem of the brain responsible for memory storage, pro-cessing, and recall.

Depending on the degree of amnesia and its cause,victims may be able to lead relatively normal lives.Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on othermemory systems to compensate for what is lost.\\nPrevention\\nAmnesia is only preventable in so far as brain injury\\ncan be prevented or minimized. Common sense approach-es include wearing a helmet when bicycling or participat-ing in potentially dangerous sports, using automobile seatbelts, and avoiding excessive alcohol or drug use. Braininfections should be treated swiftly and aggressively tominimize the damage due to swelling. Victims of strokes,brain aneurysms, and transient ischemic attacks shouldseek immediate medical treatment.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCohen, Neal J., and Howard Eichenbaum.

A\\nsample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus inthe womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’sabdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed onfetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence ofmany types of genetic disorders, thus allowing doctorsand prospective parents to make important decisionsabout early treatment and intervention.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 153AmniocentesisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 153', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 147}), Document(page_content='Purpose\\nSince the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been used\\nroutinely to test for Down syndrome , by far the most\\ncommon, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflictingabout one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately800 different diagnostic tests were available, most ofthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs\\ndisease , sickle cell anemia, hemophilia ,muscular dys-\\ntrophy and cystic fibrosis .\\nAmniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended\\nfor women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. Itis also recommended for women who have already bornechildren with birth defects , or when either of the parents\\nhas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-tic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is toconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain otherdefects which may have shown up previously during rou-tine maternal blood screening.\\nThe risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary\\ngenetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-ed to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greaterthe risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to beginamnio testing because that is the age at which the risk ofcarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals therisk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about\\none in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-nant women over 35 in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than 35.\\nOne of the most common reasons for performing\\namniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetusand present in the mother’s blood. A simple bloodscreening, usually conducted around the 15th week ofpregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’sblood. Levels that are too high or too low may signalpossible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-positive rate, another test such as amnio is recommendedwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.\\nAmniocentesis is generally performed during the\\n16th week of pregnancy, with results usually availablewithin three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio asearly as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-ed because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-carriage when done at this time. The advantage of earlyamnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-sion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatmentof the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the factthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial the\\nearlier they are performed.\\nPrecautions\\nAs an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,\\nalthough small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents mustweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, orindeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small riskof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. Theserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse testresults can bring must also be considered. The decision toundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.\\nDescription\\nThe word amniocentesis literally means “puncture\\nof the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which adeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy. Duringthe sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a veryfine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterusand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately oneounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-less procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-times using local anesthesia.\\nThe physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-\\ndle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-ing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-dle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the womancan return home after a brief observation period. Shemay be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and toavoid heavy lifting for two days.\\nThe sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory\\nwhere fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated andgrown in order to provide enough genetic material fortesting. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material isthen extracted and treated so that visual examination fordefects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs,the simple presence of a telltale chemical compound inthe amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis.Depending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill ofthe lab conducting them, all the results are availablebetween one and four weeks after the sample is taken.\\nCost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab,\\nand the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage forwomen over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternalblood screening results, and when genetic disorders runin the family.\\nAn alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori-\\nonic villus sampling , or CVS, which can be performed as\\nearly as the eighth week of pregnancy. While this allowsfor the possibility of a first trimester abortion, if warrant-ed, CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 154AmniocentesisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 154', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 148}), Document(page_content='The most promising area of new research in prenatal test-\\ning involves expanding the scope and accuracy of mater-nal blood screening as this poses no risk to the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIt is important for a woman to fully understand the\\nprocedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician per-forming it. Evidence suggests that a physician’s experi-ence with the procedure reduces the chance of mishap.Almost all obstetricians are experienced in performingamniocentesis. The patient should feel free to ask ques-tions and seek emotional support before, during and afterthe amnio is performed.\\nAftercare\\nNecessary aftercare falls into two categories, physi-\\ncal and emotional.\\nPhysical aftercare\\nDuring and immediately following the sampling\\nprocedure, a woman may experience dizziness , nausea, arapid heartbeat, and cramping. Once past these immedi-\\nate hurdles, the physician will send the woman homewith instructions to rest and to report any complicationsrequiring immediate treatment, including:\\n• vaginal bleeding. The appearance of blood could signal\\na problem.\\n•premature labor . Unusual abdominal pain and/or\\ncramping may indicate the onset of premature labor.Mild cramping for the first day or two following theprocedure is normal.\\n• signs of infection. Leaking of amniotic fluid or unusual\\nvaginal discharge, and fever could signal the onset of\\ninfection.\\nEmotional aftercare\\nOnce the procedure has been safely completed, the\\nanxiety of waiting for the test results can prove to be the\\nworst part of the process. A woman should seek andreceive emotional support from family and friends, aswell as from her obstetrician and family doctor. Profes-sional counseling may also prove necessary, particularlyif a fetal defect is discovered.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 155Amniocentesis\\nA physician uses an ultrasound monitor (left) to position the needle for insertion into the amnion when performing amnio-\\ncentesis.

It is performed to remove diseased tis-sue or relieve pain .\\nPurpose\\nArms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes can all be\\namputated. Most amputations involve small body partssuch as a finger, rather than an entire limb. About 65,000amputations are performed in the United States each year.\\nAmputation is performed for the following reasons:\\n• to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate blood\\nsupply\\n• to remove malignant tumors• because of severe trauma to the body part\\nThe blood supply to an extremity can be cut off\\nbecause of injury to the blood vessel, hardening of thearteries, arterial embolism , impaired circulation as a\\ncomplication of diabetes mellitus , repeated severe infec-\\ntion that leads to gangrene , severe frostbite, Raynaud’s\\ndisease , or Buerger’s disease .\\nMore than 90% of amputations performed in the\\nUnited States are due to circulatory complications of dia-betes.

Patients with blood clotting disorders are also not\\ngood candidates for amputation.\\nDescription\\nAmputations can be either planned or emergency\\nprocedures. Injury and arterial embolisms are the mainreasons for emergency amputations. The operation isperformed under regional or general anesthesia by a gen-eral or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room.\\nDetails of the operation vary slightly depending on\\nwhat part is to be removed. The goal of all amputations istwofold: to remove diseased tissue so that the wound willheal cleanly, and to construct a stump that will allow theattachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part.\\nThe surgeon makes an incision around the part to be\\namputated. The part is removed, and the bone is smoothed.A flap is constructed of muscle, connective tissue, andskin to cover the raw end of the bone. The flap is closedover the bone with sutures (surgical stitches) that remainin place for about one month. Often, a rigid dressing or\\ncast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an amputation is performed, extensive testing\\nis done to determine the proper level of amputation. Thegoal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing ismost likely to be complete, while allowing the maximumamount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation .\\nThe greater the blood flow through an area, the more\\nlikely healing is to occur. These tests are designed to mea-sure blood flow through the limb. Several or all of themcan be done to help choose the proper level of amputation.\\n• measurement of blood pressure in different parts of the\\nlimb\\n• xenon 133 studies, which use a radiopharmaceutical to\\nmeasure blood flow\\n• oxygen tension measurements in which an oxygen elec-\\ntrode is used to measure oxygen pressure under the skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 158Amputation\\nFigure D Figure BFigure AFemurSkin flap Exposed\\nmuscle\\nFigure CSciatic\\nnerve\\nAmputation of leg.

The stump is moved often to encourage goodcirculation. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are startedas soon as possible, usually within 48 hours. Studies haveshown that there is a positive relationship between earlyrehabilitation and effective functioning of the stump andprosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on theseverity of the amputation and the general health of theamputee, but ranges from several days to two weeks.\\nRehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especially\\nfor above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical thera-py is not uncommon. In addition, psychological counsel-ing is an important part of rehabilitation. Many peoplefeel a sense of loss and grief when they lose a body part.Others are bothered by phantom limb syndrome, wherethey feel as if the amputated part is still in place. Theymay even feel pain in this limb that does not exist. Manyamputees benefit from joining self-help groups andmeeting others who are also living with amputation.Addressing the emotional aspects of amputation oftenspeeds the physical rehabilitation process.\\nRisks\\nAmputation is major surgery. All the risks associated\\nwith the administration of anesthesia exist, along withthe possibility of heavy blood loss and the developmentof blood clots. Infection is of special concern toamputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. Ifthe stump becomes infected, it is necessary to remove theprosthesis and sometimes to amputate a second time at ahigher level.\\nFailure of the stump to heal is another major compli-\\ncation.

Pancreatitis , for\\nexample, is the most common reason for a high amylaselevel. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapesfrom the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hoursafter the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start torise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-ally returning to normal.\\nThere are other causes of increased amylase. An\\nulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes intothe pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood.During a mumps infection, amylase from the inflamed\\nsalivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in theliver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation ofthese tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease,tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning , ruptured\\naortic aneurysm , and intestinal strangulation or perfora-\\ntion can also cause unusually high amylase levels.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis-\\nease.\\nDescription\\nAmylase testing is done on both blood and urine.\\nThe laboratory may use any of several testing methodsthat involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub-stance with which amylase is known to react. By measur-ing the end-product or the reaction time, technicians cancalculate the amount of amylase present in the sample.More sophisticated methods separately measure the amy-lase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by thesalivary glands.\\nUrine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy-\\nlase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylasefrom the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10hours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine isusually collected throughout a 2- or 24-hour time period.Results are usually available the same day.\\nPreparation\\nIn most cases, no special preparation is necessary for\\na person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients takinglonger term urine amylase tests will be given a containerand instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urineshould be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site\\nor the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply-ing warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nEight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis will\\nhave high amylase levels, up to four times the normallevel. Other causes of increased amylase, such asmumps, kidney failure, pregnancy occurring in the\\nabdomen but outside the uterus ( ectopic pregnancy ),\\ncertain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complicationsof diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer , are further\\ninvestigated based on the person’s symptoms, medicalhistory, and the results of other tests.\\nIn kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient at\\nremoving amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in theblood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.\\nPeople with macroamylasia have large clumps of\\namylase in their blood. These clumps are too large tomove through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy-lase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urinewill be low.\\nAmylase levels may be low in severe liver disease\\n(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreasfails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build upin the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), followingburns , in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic\\nfibrosis . Some medications can raise or lower levels.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nA Manual of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests. 5th ed. Ed.\\nFrancis Fishback.

Amyloidosis, which occurs when accu-mulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function,can cause organ failure or death . It is a rare disease,\\noccurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. Itaffects males and females equally and usually developsafter the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis havebeen identified. Each one is associated with deposits of adifferent kind of protein.\\nTypes of amyloidosis\\nThe major forms of this disease are primary sys-\\ntemic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis.There is also another form of amyloidosis associatedwith Alzheimer’s disease .\\nPrimary systemic amyloidosis usually develops\\nbetween the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 newcases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloidosisKEY TERMS\\nAmylase —A digestive enzyme made primarily by\\nthe pancreas and salivary glands.\\nEnzyme —A substance made and used by the body\\nto trigger specific chemical reactions.\\nPancreatitis —Inflammation of the pancreas.is the most common form of this disease in the United\\nStates. Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, itmay also occur in association with multiple myeloma\\n(bone marrow cancer ).\\nSecondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-\\ntion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with:\\n•familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection\\ncharacterized by chills, weakness, headache , and\\nrecurring fever )\\n• granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intes-\\ntine)\\n• Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)• leprosy• osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone\\nmarrow)\\n• rheumatoid arthritis\\nFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher-\\nited form of the disease. It occurs in members of mostethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive patternof symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi-dosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which meansthat only one copy of the defective gene is necessary tocause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy-loidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.\\nAmyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the\\nbody. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, andnervous system are affected most often. Other commonsites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints,liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of amyloidosis is unknown. Most patients\\nhave gastrointestinal abnormalities, but other symptomsvary according to the organ(s) or system(s) affected bythe disease. Usually the affected organs are rubbery, firm,and enlarged.\\nHeart\\nBecause amyloid protein deposits can limit the\\nheart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even theslightest exertion can cause shortness of breath . If the\\nheart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s rhythmmay become erratic. The heart may also be enlarged andheart murmurs may be present. Congestive heart fail-\\nuremay result.\\nKidneys\\nThe feet, ankles, and calves swell when amyloidosis\\ndamages the kidneys.

It is also known asmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after thebaseball player whose career it ended.\\nDescription\\nALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve\\ncells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (uppermotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheralnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-ment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,leading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-ly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-tary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and ofitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, theheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-tem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people withALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-er, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss ofintellectual function ( dementia ) or sensory symptoms.\\n“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a\\ncardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of theregions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”describes the hardened tissue that develops in place ofhealthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 peoplein the United States, with about 5,000 new cases eachyear. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,although younger onset is possible. Men are slightlymore likely to develop ALS than women.\\nALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal\\nwithin three years for 50% of all people affected, andwithin five years for 80%. Ten percent of people withALS live beyond eight years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of\\nmotor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, theseneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to themuscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,neck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles theyenervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weaknessresults. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to musclewasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motorneurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, andabnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neuronscauses muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).\\nAlthough many causes of motor neuron degenera-\\ntion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet beenproven responsible. Results of recent research haveimplicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi-cals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of eventsleads to excess free radical production inside motor neu-rons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should beproduced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether thisexcess is the cause or the effect of other degenerativeprocesses. Additional agents within this toxic cascademay include excessive levels of a neurotransmitterknown as glutamate, which may over-stimulate motorneurons, thereby increasing free-radical production, anda faulty detoxification enzyme known as SOD-1, for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 163Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 163', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 157}), Document(page_content='superoxide dismutase type 1. The actual pathway of\\ndestruction is not known, however, nor is the trigger forthe rapid degeneration that marks ALS. Further researchmay show that other pathways are involved, perhaps oneseven more important than this one. Autoimmune factorsor premature aging may play some role, as could viral\\nagents or environmental toxins.\\nTwo major forms of ALS are known: familial and\\nsporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALScases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is believed to becaused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genes.About 15% of families with this type of ALS have muta-tions in the gene for SOD-1. SOD-1 gene defects are dom-inant, meaning only one gene copy is needed to developthe disease. Therefore, a parent with the faulty gene has a50% chance of passing the gene along to a child.Sporadic ALS has no known cause. While many\\nenvironmental toxins have been suggested as causes, todate no research has confirmed any of the candidatesinvestigated, including aluminum and mercury and leadfrom dental fillings. As research progresses, it is likelythat many cases of sporadic ALS will be shown to have agenetic basis as well.\\nA third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs in\\nGuam and other Pacific islands.

Leg weaknessmay first become apparent by an increased frequency ofstumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi-culty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul-ty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss ofdexterity in the fingers.\\nLess often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in\\nthe bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and\\nthroat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Aperson with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tiredafter speaking at length, or speech may become slurred.\\nIn addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs of\\nALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic-ulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomesobvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people withoutthe disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS.\\nWhile initial weakness may be limited to one region,\\nALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtuallyall the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp-toms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms andhands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold thehead up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makesbreathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con-trol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi-ration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec-tion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilatorand scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS maylive much longer than the average, although weakness andwasting will continue to erode any remaining functionalabilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain functionof the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowingsome communication to take place with simple blinks orthrough use of a computer-assisted device.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med-\\nical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam-ination to determine the distribution and extent of weak-ness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec-tromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag-nostic process. Various other tests, including blood andurine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule outother possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors ofthe skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis-ease, spinal arthritis, lead poisoning , or severe vitamin\\ndeficiency. ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a care-ful review of all these factors.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that can\\nsignificantly alter its course.

Riluzole (Rilutek) appears to pro-vide on average a three-month increase in life expectancywhen taken regularly early in the disease, and shows asignificant slowing of the loss of muscle strength. Rilu-zole acts by decreasing glutamate release from nerve ter-minals. Experimental trials of nerve growth factor havenot demonstrated any benefit. No other drug or vitamincurrently available has been shown to have any effect onthe course of ALS.\\nA physical therapist works with an affected person\\nand family to implement exercise and stretching pro-\\ngrams to maintain strength and range of motion, and topromote general health. Swimming may be a goodchoice for people with ALS, as it provides a low-impactworkout to most muscle groups. One result of chronicinactivity is contracture, or muscle shortening. Contrac-\\ntures limit a person’s range of motion, and are often\\npainful. Regular stretching can prevent contracture.

Later in the disease, nutri-\\ntion may be provided by a gastrostomy tube inserted\\ninto the stomach.\\nMechanical ventilation may be used when breathing\\nbecomes too difficult. Modern mechanical ventilators aresmall and portable, allowing a person with ALS to main-tain the maximum level of function and mobility. Ventila-tion may be administered through a mouth or nose piece,or through a tracheostomy tube. This tube is insertedthrough a small hole made in the windpipe. In addition toproviding direct access to the airway, the tube alsodecreases the risk aspiration. While many people withrapidly progressing ALS choose not to use ventilators forlengthy periods, they are increasingly being used to pro-long life for a short time.\\nThe progressive nature of ALS means that most per-\\nsons will eventually require full-time nursing care. Thiscare is often provided by a spouse or other family mem-ber. While the skills involved are not difficult to learn,the physical and emotional burden of care can be over-whelming. Caregivers need to recognize and provide fortheir own needs as well as those of people with ALS, toprevent depression, burnout, and bitterness.\\nThroughout the disease, a support group can provide\\nimportant psychological aid to affected persons and theircaregivers as they come to terms with the losses ALSinflicts. Support groups are sponsored by both the ALSSociety and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGiven the grave prognosis and absence of tradition-\\nal medical treatments, it is not surprising that a largenumber of alternative treatments have been tried forALS. Two studies published in 1988 suggested thatamino-acid therapies may provide some improvementfor some people with ALS. While individual reportsclaim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medi-cine, and removal of dental fillings, for instance, no evi-dence suggests that these offer any more than a briefpsychological boost, often followed by a more severeletdown when it becomes apparent the disease has con-tinued unabated. However, once the causes of ALS arebetter understood, alternative therapies may be moreintensively studied. For example, if damage by free radi-cals turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,antioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used\\nmore routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, ifenvironmental toxins are implicated, alternative thera-pies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be ofsome use.Prognosis\\nALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to death\\nfrom respiratory infection within three to five years inmost cases. The slowest disease progression is seen inthose who are young and have their first symptoms in thelimbs. About 10% of people with ALS live longer thaneight years.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent ALS or to alter its\\ncourse.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAdams, Raymond D, Victor, Maurice and Ropper, Allan H.\\nAdam’s & Victor’s Principles of Neurology, 6th ed.

Anaerobic bacteria can infect deepwounds , deep tissues, and internal organs where there is\\nlittle oxygen. These infections are characterized byabscess formation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue\\ndestruction.\\nDescription\\nAnaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac-\\nteria grow in places which completely, or almost com-pletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in themouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin.Commonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteriainclude gas gangrene ,tetanus , and botulism . Nearly all\\ndental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria.Anaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a\\nnormal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)is damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,the immune system kills any invading bacteria, butsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause aninfection. Body sites that have tissue destruction(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygenand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The lowoxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,shock , injury, and surgery.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically\\nanywhere in the body. For example:\\n• Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the root\\ncanals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses,and ears.\\n• Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia , lung\\nabscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung ( empye-\\nma), and dilated lung bronchi ( bronchiectasis ).\\n• Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the\\nabdomen include abscess formation, peritonitis , and\\nappendicitis .\\n• Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\npelvic abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease ,\\ninflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), andpelvic infections following abortion, childbirth , and\\nsurgery.\\n• Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common\\ncauses of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructiveinfection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing fasci-tis), and bite wound infections.\\n• Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\nbrain and spinal cord abscesses.\\n• Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the\\nbloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac-teremia).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPeople who have experienced shock, injury, or\\nsurgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumorsare at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte-ria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteriawhich can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobicinfections are “mixed infections” which means thatthere is a mixture of different bacteria growing. Theanaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infectionsare Bacteroides fragilis ,Peptostreptococcus , and\\nClostridium species.\\nThe signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection\\ncan vary depending on the location of the infection.

Pain, fever, and possibly, if fol-\\nlowing surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the wound.\\n• Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood draining\\nfrom the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain, fever,and chills.\\n• Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red,\\npainful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus.Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness,and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drainsfoul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may causeextensive tissue destruction (necrosis).\\n• Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high fever\\n(up to 105°F [40.6°C]), chills, a general ill feeling, andis potentially fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-\\nmarily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, andlocation of the infection. A foul-smelling infection ordrainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobicinfection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac-teria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late inthe infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection includetissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. Asample from the infected site may be obtained, using aswab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte-ria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteriacan be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in thelaboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.KEY TERMS\\nAbscess —A lump filled with pus resulting from an\\ninfection.\\nAnaerobic —Living and growing in the absence of\\noxygen.\\nNecrosis —Tissue death and destruction resulting\\nfrom infection or disease.The recent medical history of the patient is helpful\\nin diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has orrecently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vesseldisease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. Thefailure to improve following treatment with antibiotics\\nthat aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that theinfection is caused by anaerobes. The location and typeof infection also help in the diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if\\nbacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look atinternal infections.\\nTreatment\\nSerious infections may require hospitalization for\\ntreatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobicinfections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identifythe bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi-otic will work best. Every antibiotic does not workagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes arekilled by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida-zole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin).Other antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin(Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).\\nSurgical removal or drainage of the abscess is\\nalmost always required. This may involve drainage byneedle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess(called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior tothe aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscessescan be drained using this procedure with the help ofultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualizeinternal organs). This type of abscess drainage may beperformed in the doctor’s office.\\nPrognosis\\nComplete recovery should be achieved with the\\nappropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment.

In boys\\nwith high anal atresia, there may be a channel (fistula)connecting the large intestine to either the urethra (whichdelivers urine from the bladder) or the bladder itself. Ingirls, the channel may connect with the vagina. Sixtypercent of children with high anal atresia have otherdefects, including problems with the esophagus, urinarytract, and bones. In low anal atresia, the channel mayopen in front of the circular mass of muscles that con-strict to close the anal opening (anal sphincter) or, inboys, below the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine endsjust under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormali-ties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys.A mother who has one child with these kind of condi-tions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf-fers from this ailment.\\nCause and symptoms\\nAnal atresia is a defect in the development of the\\nfetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play aminor role.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsually a physician can make an obvious visual\\ndiagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,however, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed andsigns of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of thefirst or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom-iting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre-sia and the exact position, x rays will be taken whichinclude injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\\nscans (CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech-\\nniques used to determine the type and size of the analatresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass xrays through the body at different angles, and an MRIuses a magnetic field and radio waves.KEY TERMS\\nAnus —The canal at the end of the large intestine\\nthrough which waste is excreted to the outside ofthe body.\\nBowel obstruction —Anything that prevents waste\\nfrom moving normally to the anal opening.\\nColostomy —An operation where the large intes-\\ntine is diverted through an opening in theabdomen and waste is excreted.\\nFeces —Bodily waste material that normally passes\\nthrough the anus.\\nFistula —An abnormal channel that connects two\\norgans or connects an organ to the skin.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For\\nhigh anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made,a surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make atemporary opening ( colostomy ) in the abdomen where\\nwaste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine ismoved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part ofthe anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy isclosed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate-ly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open thearea where the anus should be. If the channel is in thewrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi-tion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery,the pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate orwiden the rectum and teaches the parents how to do thisdaily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting.\\nPrognosis\\nWith high anal atresia, many children have problems\\ncontrolling bowel function. Most also become constipat-ed. With low anal atresia, children generally have goodbowel control, but they may still become constipated.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent anal atresia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFreeman, Neill V . “Anorectal Malformations.” In Surgery of the\\nNewborn.

The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long endportion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solidwastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestineinclude the colon and the rectum.\\nDescription\\nDifferent cancers can develop in different parts of\\nthe anus, part of which is inside the body and part ofwhich is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of theanus are harmless in their early stages but may laterdevelop into cancer. Some anal warts , for example, con-\\ntain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer.Types of anal cancer include:\\n• Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of\\nanal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arisefrom the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal.The anal margin is the part of the anus that is half insideand half outside the body, and the anal canal is the partof the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form ofsquamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma insitu, or Bowen’s disease.\\n• Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth to\\none-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas.These tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa-ca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal andthe rectum.\\n• Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are ade-\\nnocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal area. Onetype of adenocarcinoma that can occur in the anal areais called Paget’s disease, which can also affect thevulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.\\n• Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are\\neither basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas,two types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, whichdevelop from skin cells that produce the brown pigmentcalled melanin, are far more common on areas of thebody exposed to the sun.\\nApproximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed\\nwith anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu-als will die of the disease during this same interval,according to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancersare fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancersaffecting the digestive system. The disease affectswomen somewhat more often than men, although thenumber of cases among men, particularly homosexualmen, seems to be increasing.Causes and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,\\nalthough certain individuals appear to have a higher riskof developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, asare individuals with certain types of the human papillo-mavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems inthe anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu-las. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac-tice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of analcancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex areabout 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het-erosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems,such individuals with HIV, or transplant patients takingimmunosuppressant drugs , are also at higher risk.\\nMost individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50.\\nSymptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in\\nother harmless conditions. They include pain ,itching\\nand bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,change in bowel habits, change in the diameter of thestool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodesin the anal or groin area.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine\\nphysicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoidremoval. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal\\nexamination (DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved,\\nlubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths.Individuals over the age of 50 who have no symptomsshould have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every  fiveto 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS)guidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer.\\nOther diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include:\\nAnoscopy . A procedure that involves use of a special\\ndevice to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure thatinvolves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran-srectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves areused to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues.\\nA biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;\\nthat is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under amicroscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per-form a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy,in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymphnodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancerhasn’t spread to these nodes.\\nAnal cancer severity is categorized by the following\\nstages:\\n• Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of\\nanal tissue.\\n• Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of\\nanal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 170Anal cancerGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 170', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 164}), Document(page_content='• Stage II anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of\\nanal tissue and is larger than 1 inch in diameter, but hasnot spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes.\\n• Stage IIIA anal cancer has spread to the lymph nodes\\naround the rectum or to nearby organs such as the vagi-na or bladder.\\n• Stage IIIB anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the\\nmid-abdomen or groin, or to nearby organs and thelymph nodes around the rectum.\\n• Stage IV anal cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes\\nwithin the abdomen or to distant organs.\\nTreatment\\nAnal cancer is treated using three methods, used\\neither in concert or individually: surgery, radiation ther-\\napy, and chemotherapy .\\nTwo types of surgery may be performed. A local\\nresection, performed if the cancer has not spread,removes the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumor.An abdominoperineal resection is a more complex proce-dure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removed,and an opening called a colostomy is created for body\\nwastes to exit. This procedure is fairly uncommon todaybecause radiation and chemotherapy are just as effective.\\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy rays to fight\\ncancer cells. It is usually delivered via a machine outsidethe body, but may also be delivered via surgicallyimplanted radioactive pellets. This latter method is calledinternal radiation, brachytherapy, or interstitial radiation.Side effects of radiation may include tiredness, skin dam-age resembling sunburn , and damage to anal tissues.\\nChemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which may\\nbe delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy typeskill cancer cells directly, while others act indirectly bymaking cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. Themain drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin. Side effects ofchemotherapy, which damages normal cells in addition tocancer cells, may include nausea and vomiting , hair\\nloss, loss of appetite, diarrhea , mouth sores, fatigue ,\\nshortness of breath , and a weakened immune system.\\nAlternative treatment\\nResearch suggests acupuncture can help manage\\nchemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and controlpain associated with surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nAnal cancer is often curable.

They can be yellow, pink, or lightbrown in color, and only rarely are painful or uncomfort-able. In fact, infected individuals often are unaware thatthey exist. Most cases are caused by sexual transmission.\\nMost individuals have between one to 10 genital\\nwarts thtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm\\n2. Some\\nwill complain of painless bumps or itching , but often,\\nthese warts can remain completely unnoticed.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCondyloma acuminatum is one of the most common\\nsexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk.Risk factors include smoking , using oral contracep-\\ntives , having multiple sexual partners, and an early coital\\nage. In addition, individuals who have a history ofimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.\\nRoughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the\\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which arethe least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can-cerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through directsexual contact with someone who is infected with condy-loma acuminata anywhere in the genital area, includingthe penis and vagina. Studies have shown that roughly75% of those who engage in sexual contact with some-one infected with condyloma acuminata will developthese warts within three months.\\nTreatment\\nAccording to guidelines from the Centers for Dis-\\nease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts,including anal warts, should be conducted according tothe methods preferred by the patient, the medications orprocedures most readily available, and the experience ofthe patient’s physician in removing anal warts.\\nTreatment options include electrical cautery, surgi-\\ncal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the analcanal will almost always be treated with cauterization orsurgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci-sion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrencerates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure ratesrange from 63–91%.\\nUnfortunately, most cases require numerous treat-\\nments because the virus that causes the warts can live inthe surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal andwart-free for six months or longer before another wartdevelops.\\nLaser surgery is another possibility, but requires\\nlocal, general, or spinal anesthesia, depending on thenumber warts and where they are.\\nElectrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical\\nenergy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful ofthe procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminataof the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It isdone with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge orbleeding from the anus.\\nFollow-up visits to the physician are necessary to\\nmake sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom-mended that these patients see their physicians everythree to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how longthe incubation period is for the HPV virus.\\nCarbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-\\ntion are other options, but these are usually reserved forextensive warts or those that continue to recur despitenumerous treatments. However, because HPV virus canbe transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures,they are usually reserved for the worst infections.\\nFor small warts that affect only the skin around the\\nanus, several medications are available, which can beapplied directly to the surface of the warts by a physicianor by the patients themselves.\\nSuch medications include podophyllum resin\\n(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from thecytotoxic extracts of several plants. This agent offers a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 172Anal wartsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 172', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 166}), Document(page_content='cure rate of 20–50% when used alone, and is applied by\\nthe physician weekly and then washed off 6 hours laterby the patient.\\nPodofilox (Condylox) is another agent, and is avail-\\nable for patients to use at home. It can be applied twicedaily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a slightly highercure rate than podophyllin, and can also be used to pre-vent warts.\\nTrichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail-\\nable in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat-ment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to cau-terize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless, theycause less irritation and overall body effects than theother agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, ishigher with these acids.\\nBleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment option,\\nbut it has several drawbacks. First, it must be adminis-tered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but iscan have a host of side effects, and patients must be fol-lowed carefully by their physician.\\nImiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients to\\napply themselves. It is to be applied three times weekly,for up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to clear wartswithin eight to 10 weeks.\\nFinally, the interferon drugs, which are naturally\\noccurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumoreffects, are available. These include interferon alfa 2aand 2b (Roferon, Intron A), which are to be injected intoeach lesion twice a week for up to eight weeks.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce a diagnosis of anal warts has been made, fur-\\nther outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes preventedwith proper care. Unfortunately, many cases of anal wartseither fail to respond to treatment or recur. Patients haveto undergo roughly six to nine treatments over severalmonths to assure that the warts are completely eradicated.\\nRecurrence rates have been estimated to be over 50%\\nafter one year and may be due to the long incubation ofHPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions,virus present in surrounding skin that is not treated.\\nPrevention\\nSexual abstinence and monogamous relationships can\\nbe the most effective form of prevention, and condomsmay also decrease the chances of transmission of condylo-ma acuminata. Abstinence from sexual relations with peo-ple who have anal or genital warts can prevent infection.Unfortunately, since many people may not be aware thatthey have this condition, this is not always possible.KEY TERMS\\nElectrocoagulation —a technique using electrical\\nenergy to destroy the warts. Usually done for wartswithin the anus with a local anesthesia, electroco-agulation is most painful form of therapy, and cancause both bleeding and discharge from the anus.\\nIndividuals infected with anal warts should have fol-\\nlow-up checkups every few weeks after their initial treat-ment, after which self-exams can be done.\\nSexual partners of people who have anal warts\\nshould also be examined, as a precautionary preventivemeasure.\\nFinally, 5-flourouracil (Adrucil, Efudex, Fluoroplex)\\nmay be useful to prevent recurrence once the warts havebeen removed.

Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti-\\ndepressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin,have been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologicpain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal-gesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect oncausation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue oftheir dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.\\nDescription\\nPain has been classified as “productive” pain and\\n“non-productive” pain. While this distinction has nophysiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat-ment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warningof injury, and so may be both an indication of need fortreatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive”pain by definition serves no purpose either as a warningor diagnostic tool.\\nAlthough pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the\\ncommon factor is a sensory pathway from the affectedorgan to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of thenerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheralnervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by thecentral nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal-gesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factorsof each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity ofpain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain hasbeen divided into two classes, acute and chronic,although severity and projected patient survival are otherfactors that must be considered in drug selection.\\nAcute pain\\nAcute pain is self limiting in duration, and includes\\npost-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth .\\nBecause pain of these types is expected to be short term,the long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou-tinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely betreated with narcotic analgesics without concern for theiraddictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concernfor their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should beadjusted based on observation of healing rate, switchingpatients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal-gesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit.\\nAn important consideration of pain management in\\nsevere pain is that patients should not be subject to thereturn of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately toassure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequentlyenough to avoid the anxiety that accompanies the antici-\\npated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed ona “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered oftenenough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This\\napplies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.\\nChronic pain\\nChronic pain, pain lasting over three months and\\nsevere enough to impair function, is more difficult totreat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesicsare more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal-gesics this means the addiction potential, as well as res-\\npiratory depression and constipation . For the NSAIDs,\\nthe risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. Whilesome classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag-onist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine,and the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe-coxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects,they are still not fully suitable for long-term managementof severe pain. Generally, chronic pain managementrequires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi-cation, and other treatment modalities.\\nNarcotic analgesics\\nThe narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are all\\nderived from opium. The class includes morphine,codeine, and a number of semi-synthetics includingmeperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth-ers. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all areeffective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade-quate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Becausethese drugs are all addictive, they are controlled underfederal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms areavailable, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous andintrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.\\nNSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are\\neffective analgesics even at doses too low to have anyanti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi-cal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects andside effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis-tration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate forinjection and may be used in moderate to severe pain forshort periods.\\nAcetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no\\nanti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild tomoderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor-mal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses.Because acetaminophen is largely free of side effects attherapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choicefor mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis .\\nRecommended dosage\\nAppropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con-\\nsider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 174AnalgesicsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 174', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 168}), Document(page_content='with patient age and condition.

Some are used before or duringsurgery (including dental surgery) both to relieve pain andto make anesthetics work more effectively. They may alsobe used for the same purposes during labor and delivery.\\nDescription\\nOpioid analgesics relieve pain by acting directly on\\nthe central nervous system. However, this can also leadto unwanted side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness ,\\nbreathing problems, and physical or mental dependence.\\nAmong the drugs in this category are codeine, pro-\\npoxyphene (Darvon), propoxyphene and acetaminophen\\n(Darvocet N), meperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone(Dilaudid), morphine, oxycodone, oxycodone and aceta-minophen (Percocet, Roxicet), and hydrocodone andacetaminophen (Lortab, Anexsia). These drugs come inmany forms—tablets, syrups, suppositories, and injec-tions, and are sold only by prescription. For some, a newprescription is required for each new supply—refills areprohibited according to federal regulations.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended doses vary, depending on the type of\\nopioid analgesic and the form in which it is being used.Doses may be different for different patients.

Unlike other allergicreactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction maybegin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, andrapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin andintestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severecases, it can result in complete airway obstruction,shock , and death .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nLike the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy-\\nlaxis is caused by the release of histamine and otherchemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of whiteblood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis-sues that regulate exchange with the environment: theairways, digestive system, and skin.\\nOn their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies\\ncalled IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodiesare designed to detect environmental substances towhich the immune system is sensitive. Substances froma genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria orviruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo-ple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergicresponse, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodiesbind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to releasehistamine and other chemicals, which spill out ontoneighboring cells.\\nThe interaction of these chemicals with receptors on\\nthe surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leakfluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula-tion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cellsof the airways and digestive system, they cause constric-tion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity andcause itching .\\nIn anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both to\\nextreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usuallysystemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to causeanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu-latory system by injection. However, exposure by inges-tion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy-laxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over timefrom less severe allergies .\\nAnaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,\\ndrugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:\\n• fish, shellfish, and mollusks• nuts and seeds• stings of bees, wasps, or hornets\\n• papain from meat tenderizers• vaccines, including flu and measles vaccines\\n• penicillin• cephalosporins\\n• streptomycin\\n• gamma globulin• insulin• hormones (ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone)•aspirin and other NSAIDs\\n• latex, from exam gloves or condoms, for example\\nExposure to cold or exercise can trigger anaphylaxis\\nin some individuals.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms may include:\\n• urticaria ( hives )\\n• swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth• swelling of the sinuses• difficulty breathing• wheezing• cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea\\n• anxiety or confusion\\n• strong, very rapid heartbeat ( palpitations )\\n• loss of consciousness\\nNot all symptoms may be present.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel-\\nopment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen.Identification of the culprit may be done with RAST test-ing, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specificallergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana-phylactic reactions.\\nTreatment\\nEmergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec-\\ntion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts bloodvessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygenmay be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids.Antihistamines may be used for skin rash, and amino-\\nphylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway isobstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto-my tube may be needed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 179AnaphylaxisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 179', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 173}), Document(page_content='Prognosis\\nThe rapidity of symptom development is an indica-\\ntion of the likely severity of reaction: the faster symp-toms develop, the more severe the ultimate reaction.Prompt emergency medical attention and close monitor-ing reduces the likelihood of death. Nonetheless, death ispossible from severe anaphylaxis. For most people whoreceive rapid treatment, recovery is complete.\\nPrevention\\nAvoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliable\\nmethod of preventing anaphylaxis. For insect allergies,this requires recognizing likely nest sites. Preventing foodallergies requires knowledge of the prepared foods ordishes in which the allergen is likely to occur, and carefulquestioning about ingredients when dining out.

Red blood cells, which containhemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughoutthe body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, theiron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and usedto create new red blood cells. Anemia develops whenheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-thing happens to slow down the production of red bloodcells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.\\nTypes of anemia\\nAnemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to\\nlead to life-threatening complications. More than 400different types of anemia have been identified. Many ofthem are rare.\\nIRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-\\nmiais the most common form of anemia in the world. In\\nthe United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition isless common in older children and in adults over 50 andrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.\\nThe onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,\\nat first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiencybegins when the body loses more iron than it derivesfrom food and other sources. Because depleted ironstores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer redblood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the redblood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.Then the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiencyby producing more red blood cells, which are character-istically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.\\nFOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi-\\nciency anemia is the most common type of megaloblas-\\ntic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor-mal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid , a vitamin\\nthat the body needs to produce normal cells.\\nFolic acid anemia is especially common in infants\\nand teenagers. Although this condition usually resultsfrom a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to inabilityto absorb enough folic acid from such foods as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 180AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 180', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 174}), Document(page_content='• cheese\\n• eggs\\n• fish\\n• green vegetables\\n• meat\\n• milk\\n• mushrooms\\n• yeast\\nSmoking raises the risk of developing this condition\\nby interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C, which thebody needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid anemia can bea complication of pregnancy , when a woman’s body\\nneeds eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.\\nVITAMIN B 12DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in\\nthis country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B12deficien-\\ncy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia thatdevelops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of thisnutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B\\n12\\nis found in meat and vegetables.\\nLarge amounts of B12are stored in the body, so this\\ncondition may not become apparent until as much as fouryears after B\\n12absorption stops or slows down. The\\nresulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:\\n• loss of muscle control\\n• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet\\n• soreness or burning of the tongue\\n• weight loss\\n• yellow-blue color blindness\\nThe most common form of B12deficiency is perni-\\ncious anemia . Since most people who eat meat or eggs\\nget enough B12in their diets , a deficiency of this vitamin\\nusually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.This can occur among people who have had intestinalsurgery or among those who do not produce adequateamounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by thestomach lining that combines with B\\n12to help its absorp-\\ntion in the small intestine.\\nPernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages\\nof 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas-es the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:\\n• diabetes mellitus•gastritis ,stomach cancer , or stomach surgery\\n• thyroid disease\\n• family history of pernicious anemia\\nVITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder\\nthat causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormallysmall red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia\\nresults from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.\\nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with\\nhemolytic anemia . Some acquire this condition, in\\nwhich infection or antibodies destroy red blood cellsmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.\\nHemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat-\\ning the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Othercomplications of hemolytic anemia include:\\n•pain\\n• shock• gallstones and other serious health problems\\nTHALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic\\nanemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability to\\nmanufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs.There are two categories of thalassemia, depending onwhich of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobinis composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha-lassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of thealpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there isan imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias mostcommonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene);beta-thalassemias most commonly affect people ofMediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.\\nCharacterized by production of red blood cells that\\nare unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affectspeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto-somal recessive inheritance).\\nAUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-\\nbody hemolytic anemia is the most common type of thisdisorder. This condition occurs when the body producesautoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cellsare destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow.\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common\\nin women than in men. About one-third of patients whohave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-phoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.\\nIn cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks\\nred blood cells at or below normal body temperature. Theacute form of this condition frequently develops in peo-ple who have had pneumonia , mononeucleosis, or other\\nacute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, anddisappears without treatment.\\nChronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most\\ncommon in women and most often affects those who areover 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usuallylasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms.However, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 181AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 181', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 175}), Document(page_content='red blood cell destruction, causing fatigue , joint aches,\\nand discoloration of the arms and hands.\\nSICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Sickle cell anemia is a chron-\\nic, incurable condition that causes the body to producedefective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells toassume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal ovalcells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobinto nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes ithard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves-sels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten-ing condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur.\\nSickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always\\naffects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. Achild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parentwill have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cellgene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, butdoes not have the disease.\\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone\\nmarrow transplant, but potentially fatal, aplastic anemia\\nis characterized by decreased production of red andwhite blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells thatallow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inheritedor acquired as a result of:\\n• recent severe illness\\n• long-term exposure to industrial chemicals\\n• use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer , chronic\\ninfection or inflammation, and kidney and liver diseaseoften cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail-ure generally produces the most severe symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red blood\\ncell production, or increased red blood cell destruction.Poor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and irondeficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells areproduced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases cancause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces-sive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, andthe speed with which blood loss occurs has a significanteffect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss isusually a consequence of:\\n• cancer\\n• gastrointestinal tumors\\n• diverticulosis\\n• polyposis\\n• heavy menstrual flow\\n• hemorrhoids• nosebleeds\\n• stomach ulcers\\n• long-standing alcohol abuse\\nAcute blood loss is usually the result of:\\n• childbirth• injury\\n• a ruptured blood vessel\\n• surgery\\nWhen a lot of blood is lost within a short time, blood\\npressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud-denly. Heart failure and death can follow.\\nLoss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume in\\nthe space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual bloodloss is less serious, because the body has time to createnew red blood cells to replace those that have been lost.\\nSymptoms\\nWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be\\nsigns of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lackof color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, orlining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someonewho is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feelsfaint or dizzy may be severely anemic.\\nOther symptoms of anemia are:\\n• angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a\\nchoking sensation that provokes severe anxiety )\\n• cravings for ice, paint, or dirt\\n• headache\\n• inability to concentrate, memory loss\\n• inflammation of the mouth ( stomatitis ) or tongue\\n(glossitis)\\n• insomnia\\n• irregular heartbeat\\n• loss of appetite\\n• nails that are dry, brittle, or ridged\\n• rapid breathing\\n• sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum\\n• sweating\\n• swelling of the hands and feet\\n• thirst\\n• tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\\n• unexplained bleeding or bruising\\nIn pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusually\\nslick.

Laboratory tests thatmeasure the percentage of red blood cells or the amountof hemoglobin in the blood are used to confirm diagnosisand determine which type of anemia is responsible for apatient’s symptoms.

People with folic acid\\nanemia should take oral folic acid replacements. VitaminC deficiency anemia can be cured by taking one vitaminC tablet a day.\\nSurgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused by\\nexcessive loss of blood. Transfusions of red blood cellsmay be used to accelerate production of red blood cells.\\nMedication or surgery may also be necessary to con-\\ntrol heavy menstrual flow, repair a bleeding ulcer, orremove polyps (growths or nodules) from the bowels.\\nPatients with thalassemia usually do not require\\ntreatment.

For extensive blood loss, the cause shouldbe identified and corrected. Other types of anemiasshould be addressed on a deep healing level with crisisintervention when necessary.\\nMany alternative therapies for iron-deficiency ane-\\nmia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the diet or ontechniques to improve circulation and digestion. Ironsupplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likelyto cause constipation ), is used by alternative practition-\\ners. This can be given in combination with herbs that arerich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande-lion ( Taraxacum officinale ), parsley ( Petroselinum\\ncrispum ), and nettle ( Urtica dioica ). The homeopathic\\nremedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful.\\nAn iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using\\nthe following recipe:\\n• soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion\\nroot in 1 qt of boiled water for  four to 8 hours\\n• strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reduced\\nto 1 cup\\n• remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses,\\nmixing well\\n• store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily\\nOther herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiency\\nanemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian ( Gentiana\\nlutea ) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and other\\nnutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen-tian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and\\nother nutrients more available for absorption. This bitterherb can be brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholicextract (tincture).\\nOther herbs recommended to promote digestion\\ninclude:\\n• anise ( Pimpinella anisum )\\n• caraway ( Carum carvi )\\n• cumin ( Cuminum cyminum )\\n• linden ( Tilia spp.)\\n• licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra )\\nTraditional Chinese treatments for anemia include:\\n• acupuncture to stimulate a weakened spleen• asian ginseng ( Panax ginseng ) to restore energy\\n• dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ) to control heavy men-\\nstrual bleeding\\n• a mixture of dong quai and Chinese foxglove( Rehman-\\nnia glutinosa ) to clear a sallow complexion\\nPrognosis\\nFolic-acid and iron-deficiency anemias\\nIt usually takes three to six weeks to correct folic\\nacid or iron deficiency anemia.

The patient experiences analge-\\nsia or a loss of pain sensation but remains consciousand can carry on a conversation.\\n• Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience\\ndelirium or become violent. Blood pressure rises and\\nbecomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. Thisstage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu-rate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia.\\n• Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the\\nskeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathingbecomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, andsurgery can begin.\\n• Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis . This stage occurs if\\nthe respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of thebrain that control breathing and other vital functionscease to function. Death can result if the patient cannot\\nbe revived quickly. This stage should never be reached.Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis-tered prevent this occurrence.\\nAgents used for general anesthesia may be either\\ngases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaledwith oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi-nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugsare usually delivered during general anesthesia; thispractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used becauseit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, theextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a generalanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathedby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by anintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot bechanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia andthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.\\nGeneral anesthesia works by altering the flow of\\nsodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through thecell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this isnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind toany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem toaffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerveimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It isknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do notget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generatedand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas ofthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not thesame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up whileothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-sciousness is more widespread.When general anesthesia was first introduced in\\nmedical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled withthe physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.Since then, general anesthesia has become much moresophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoringas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery ofanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.\\n• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can\\neasily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-sciousness but little pain relief so it is often used withother agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxicto the liver in adults, causing death. It also has thepotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.Halothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently theanesthetic of choice for use with children, but since theintroduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothaneuse has declined.\\n• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a\\nmore rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakeningthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer ofparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found toincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients withseizure disorders.\\n• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can\\ncause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is oftenused in combination with intravenous anesthetics foranesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia isfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.\\n• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and\\nshould not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-\\nsis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-\\nmias . Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation\\nduring induction and is therefore used with intravenousanesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-nated and awakening is therefore faster than with otherinhaled agents.\\n• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart\\nrate and should not be used in patients with narrowedaortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usuallycause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-rane does not cause any coughing or other related sideeffects, and can therefore be used without intravenousagents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluoraneis replacing halothane for induction in pediatricpatients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi-nated and allows rapid awakening.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 186Anesthesia, generalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 186', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 180}), Document(page_content='• Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a weak anesthetic and is\\nused with other agents, such as thiopental, to producesurgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction andrecovery and is the safest because it does not slowbreathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus-es rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in acollapsed lung ( pneumothorax ) or lower the oxygen\\ncontents of tissues (hypoxia).\\nCommonly administered intravenous anesthetic\\nagents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol.\\n• Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces a\\ndissociative anesthesia ( catatonia , amnesia, analgesia)\\nin which the patient may appear awake and reactive, butcannot respond to sensory stimuli. These propertiesmake it especially useful for use in developing coun-tries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine isfrequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesiaand analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscularinjection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patientsand in shock cases, because it also provides cardiac\\nstimulation.\\n• Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces a\\nrapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen-tal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula-tion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuouslyinfused. Side effects include nausea and vomiting\\nupon awakening.\\n• Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and\\nare frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as asedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusionfor primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affectthe cardiovascular system, they are particularly usefulfor cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioidsact directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqentlyused in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects mayinclude nausea and vomiting, itching , and respiratory\\ndepression.\\n• Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent\\nand the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic.Its rapid induction and short duration of action are iden-tical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quicklyand with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo-fol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted inthe urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-thesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidlyreplacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent.It is used for general surgery , cardiac surgery, neuro-\\nsurgery, and pediatric surgery.\\nGeneral anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo-\\ngists, the medical professionals trained to use them. Thesespecialists consider many factors, including a patient’sage, weight, medication allergies , medical history, andgeneral health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi-\\nnation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual-ly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injectedinto a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally.\\nGeneral anesthesia is much safer today than it was in\\nthe past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,improved safety standards in the equipment used todeliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath-ing, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity duringsurgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the\\npatient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgeryor medical procedure being done, and other medicationthe patient takes before, during, or after surgery.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the risks of serious complications from\\ngeneral anesthesia are very low, they can include heart\\nattack ,stroke , brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-\\nuled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughlydiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risksof complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,weight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking ,\\ndrinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can beminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-ologist are fully informed of the detailed health conditionof the patient, including any drugs that he or she may beusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the effectsof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-ence side effects from these drugs.\\nPatients who have had general anesthesia should not\\ndrink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slowdown the central nervous system (such as antihista-\\nmines , sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain\\nrelievers, muscle relaxants , and anti-seizure medication)\\nfor at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions are at greater\\nrisk of developing problems with anesthetics.

Signs of malignant\\nhyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breath-ing problems, very high fever , and muscle tightness or\\nspasms. These symptoms can occur following the admin-istration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe-cially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also betold about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, orother substances.\\nPREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnant\\nwomen and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. Ingeneral, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to themother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug-gish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the useof anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors.Pregnant women who may be given general anesthesia forother medical procedures should ensure that the treatingphysician is informed about the pregnancy .\\nBREASTFEEDING. Some general anesthetics pass into\\nbreast milk, but they have not been reported to cause prob-lems in nursing babies whose mothers were given the drugs.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before being given\\na general anesthetic, a patient who has any of the follow-ing conditions should inform his or her doctor:\\n• neurological conditions, such as epilepsy or stroke\\n• problems with the stomach or esophagus, such as ulcers\\nor heartburn\\n• eating disorders• loose teeth, dentures, bridgework\\n• heart disease or family history of heart problems\\n• lung diseases, such as emphysema or asthma\\n• history of smoking• immune system diseases• arthritis or any other conditions that affect movement• diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes or\\nthyroid problemsSide effects\\nBecause general anesthetics affect the central ner-\\nvous system, patients may feel drowsy, weak, or tiredfor as long as a few days after having general anesthesia.Fuzzy thinking, blurred vision, and coordination prob-lems are also possible. For these reasons, anyone whohas had general anesthesia should not drive, operatemachinery, or perform other activities that could endan-ger themselves or others for at least 24 hours, or longerif necessary.\\nMost side effects usually disappear as the anesthetic\\nwears off.

Over-the-counter local anesthetics are also avail-able to provide temporary relief from pain, irritation, anditching caused by various conditions, such as cold sores,\\ncanker sores , sore throats, sunburn , insect bites, poison\\nivy, and minor cuts and scratches.\\nTypes of surgery or medical procedures that regular-\\nly make use of local or regional anesthesia include thefollowing:\\n• biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken for\\ndiagnostic procedures\\n• childbirth\\n• surgeries on the arms, hands, legs, or feet\\n• eye surgery\\n• surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organs\\nSurgeries involving the chest and abdomen are usu-\\nally performed under general anesthesia.\\nLocal and regional anesthesia have advantages over\\ngeneral anesthesia in that patients can avoid someunpleasant side effects, can receive longer lasting painrelief, have reduced blood loss, and maintain a sense ofpsychological comfort by not losing consciousness.\\nDescription\\nRegional anesthesia typically affects a larger area than\\nlocal anesthesia, for example, everything below the waist.As a result, regional anesthesia may be used for moreinvolved or complicated surgical or medical procedures.Regional anesthetics are injected. Local anesthesia involvesthe injection into the skin or muscle or application to theskin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur. Localanesthesia can be divided into four groups: injectable, topi-cal, dental (non-injectable), and ophthalmic.\\nLocal and regional anesthesia work by altering the\\nflow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neuronsthrough the cell membrane. Exactly how the anestheticdoes this is not understood, since the drug apparentlydoes not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and doesnot seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmitnerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.It is known, however, that when the sodium molecules donot get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generat-ed and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain. Theduration of action of an anesthetic depends on the typeand amount of anesthetic administered.\\nRegional anesthesia\\nTypes of regional anesthesia include:• Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the injec-\\ntion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly intothe cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord (thesubarachnoid space). Blood pressure drops are com-mon but are easily treated.\\n• Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves the\\ninjection of a large volume of local anesthetic directlyinto the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac (theepidural space), not into the spinal fluid. Pain reliefoccurs more slowly but is less likely to produce bloodpressure drops. Also, the block can be maintained forlong periods, even days.\\n• Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of an\\nanesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies aparticular region of the body, preventing the nerve fromcarrying nerve impulses to the brain.\\nAnesthetics may be administered with another drug,\\nsuch as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases bleed-ing, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of adrug so that it will work faster. In addition, drugs may beadministered to help a patient remain calm and morecomfortable or to make them sleepy.\\nLocal anesthesia\\nINJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS. These medicines\\nare given by injection to numb and provide pain relief tosome part of the body during surgery, dental procedures,or other medical procedures. They are given only by atrained health care professional and only in a doctor’soffice or a hospital. Some commonly used injectablelocal anesthetics are procaine (Novocain), lidocaine(Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine, Xylocaine,and other brands), and tetracaine (Pontocaine).\\nTOPICAL ANESTHETICS. Topical anesthetics, such as\\nbenzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine, butamben,and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by deadening thenerve endings in the skin. They are ingredients in a vari-ety of nonprescription products that are applied to theskin to relieve the discomfort of sunburn, insect bites orstings, poison ivy, and minor cuts, scratches, and burns .\\nThese products are sold as creams, ointments, sprays,lotions, and gels.\\nDENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some\\nlocal anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the mouthor throat. They may be used to relieve throat pain,teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches, or dis-comfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework. Somedental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s pre-scription. Others may be purchased without a prescrip-tion, including products such as Num-Zit, Orajel, Chlo-raseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 190Anesthesia, localGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 190', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 184}), Document(page_content='OPHTHALMIC ANESTHETICS. Other local anesthetics\\nare designed for use in the eye. The ophthalmic anestheticsproparacaine and tetracaine are used to numb the eyebefore certain eye examinations. Eye doctors may also usethese medicines before measuring eye pressure or remov-ing stitches or foreign objects from the eye. These drugs\\nare to be given only by a trained health care professional.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nlocal anesthetic and the purpose for which it is beingused. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic, fol-low the directions on the package. Questions concerninghow to use a product should be referred to a medical doc-tor, dentist, or pharmacist.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople who strongly feel that they cannot psycho-\\nlogically cope with being awake and alert during certainprocedures may not be good candidates for local orregional anesthesia. Other medications may be given inconjunction with the anesthetic, however, to relieve anxi-\\netyand help the patient relax.\\nLocal anesthetics should be used only for the condi-\\ntions for which they are intended. For example, a topicalanesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not beused on cold sores. Anyone who has had an unusual reac-tion to any local anesthetic in the past should check witha doctor before using any type of local anesthetic again.The doctor should also be told about any allergies to\\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\\nOlder people may be more sensitive to the effects of\\nlocal anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This increased sen-sitivity may increase the risk of side effects. Older peoplewho use nonprescription local anesthetics should be espe-cially careful not to use more than the recommendedamount. Children also may be especially sensitive to theeffects of some local anesthetics, which may increase thechance of side effects. Anyone using these medicines on achild should be careful not to use more than the amountthat is recommended for children. Certain types of localanesthetics should not be used at all young children. Fol-low package directions carefully and check with a doctorof pharmacist if there are any questions.\\nRegional anesthetics\\nSerious, possibly life-threatening, side effects may\\noccur when anesthetics are given to people who usestreet drugs. Anyone who uses cocaine ,marijuana ,\\namphetamines, barbiturates , phencyclidine (PCP, or\\nangel dust), heroin, or other street drugs should makesure their doctor or dentist knows what they have used.Patients who have had a particular kind of reaction\\ncalled malignant hyperthermia (or who have one or morefamily members who have had this problem) during orjust after receiving a general anesthetic should informtheir doctors before receiving any kind of anesthetic.Signs of malignant hyperthermia include fast and irregu-lar heartbeat, very high fever , breathing problems, and\\nmuscle spasms or tightness.\\nAlthough problems are rare, some unwanted side\\neffects may occur when regional anesthetics are usedduring labor and delivery. These anesthetics can prolonglabor and increase the risk of Cesarean section . Preg-\\nnant women should discuss with their doctors the risksand benefits of being given these drugs.\\nPatients should not drive or operate other machinery\\nimmediately following a procedure involving regionalanesthesia, due to numbness and weakness, or if localanesthesia also included drugs to make the patient sleepor strong pain medications. Injection sites should be keptclean, dry, and uncovered to prevent infection.\\nInjectable local anesthetics\\nUntil the anesthetic wears off, patients should be\\ncareful not to injure the numbed area. If the anestheticwas used in the mouth, do not eat or chew gum until feel-ing returns.\\nTopical anesthetics\\nUnless advised by a doctor, topical anesthetics\\nshould not be used on or near any part of the bodywith large sores, broken or scraped skin, severe injury,or infection. They should also not be used on largeareas of skin. Some topical anesthetics contain alcoholand should not be used near an open flame, or whilesmoking .\\nAnyone using a topical anesthetic should be careful\\nnot to get this medication in the eyes, nose, or mouth.When using a spray form of this medication, do not sprayit directly on the face, but apply it to the face with a cot-ton swab or sterile gauze pad. After using a topical anes-thetic on a child, make sure the child does not get themedicine in his or her mouth.\\nTopical anesthetics are intended for the temporary\\nrelief of pain and itching. They should not be used formore than a few days at a time.

This headache is severe when the patientis upright and hardly felt when the patient lies down.Though rare, it can occur and can be treated by perform-ing a blood patch, in which a small amount of thepatient’s own blood is injected into the area in the backwhere the anesthetic was injected.

The aorta is the largestartery in the body and the main blood vessel leadingaway from the heart.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an aor-\\ntic aneurysm that is likely to rupture if left in place.\\nAneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm thatgrows to at least 2 in (5 cm) or for an aortic aneurysm ofany size that is symptomatic, tender, or enlarging rapidly.\\nPrecautions\\nAneurysmectomy may not be appropriate for\\npatients with severely debilitating diseases such as can-\\ncer,emphysema , and heart failure .\\nDescription\\nAn aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aorta\\nthat is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis .\\nPeople who are 50-80 years old are most likely to devel-op an aortic aneurysm, with men four times more likelyto develop one than women.\\nAn aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It\\nrarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosedby accident during a routine physical exam or on an x rayor ultrasound done for another reason. As the aneurysmgrows larger, the risk of bursting with no warning, whichcauses catastrophic bleeding, rises. A ruptured aorticaneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of bloodwithin minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleedsthat lead within hours or days to massive bleeding. A leak-ing aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatal.Aneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two\\nmost common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal aor-tic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kid-neys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in thechest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital undergeneral anesthesia and involves removing debris andthen implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace theenlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of theascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travelsupward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lungmachine that temporarily stops the heart while theaneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a one-week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.\\nDuring surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either the\\nabdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to exposethe aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and below theaneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then, an incision ismade in the aneurysm. An artificial Dacron tube is sewn inplace above and below the opened aneurysm, but theaneurysm is not removed. Plaque or clotted blood arecleaned from the diseased tissue. The clamps are removedand blood flow is re-established through the graft. Thewall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to pro-tect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up.\\nAneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or\\nemergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes aboutan hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy,with a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective abdominalaneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective thoracicaneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm ruptures, 62% ofpatients die before they reach the hospital. Of those whomake it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. Aftera successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly thesame life expectancy as other people of the same age.\\nPreparation\\nBefore elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, a\\nchest x ray , cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram\\n(ECG), and ultrasound are performed.\\nAftercare\\nAfter aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored in\\nan Intensive Care Unit for the first 24–48 hours. Follow-up tests include ECG, chest x ray, and ultrasound.\\nRisks\\nElective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of compli-\\ncations, such as bleeding, kidney failure, respiratory com-plications, heart attack ,stroke , infection, limb loss, bowel\\nischemia , and impotence . These complications are many\\ntimes more common in emergency aneurysmectomy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 193AneurysmectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 193', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 187}), Document(page_content='Resources\\nBOOKS\\n“Aneurysmectomy.” In Current Surgical Diagnosis and Treat-\\nment. 10th ed.

It is also some-\\ntimes characterized by a feeling of choking , suffocation,\\nor crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi-na pectoris.\\nDescription\\nOften described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-\\nsation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describechest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygento the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actualheart attack , but rather pain that results from the heart\\nmuscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem-porary condition may be the result of demanding activi-ties such as exercise and does not necessarily indicate\\nthat the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage.In fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam-age to heart muscle.\\nAngina can be subdivided further into two cate-\\ngories: angina of effort and variant angina.\\nAngina of effort\\nAngina of effort is a common disorder caused by the\\nnarrowing of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) that supply\\noxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the case ofangina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries can providethe heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood duringrest but not during periods of exercise, stress , or excite-\\nment—any of which may precipitate pain. The pain isrelieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, amedication that reduces ischemia of the heart. Patientswith angina of effort have an increased risk of heartattack (myocardial infarction).\\nV ariant angina\\nVariant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-\\ndently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be presentas an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at rest andis not related to excessive work by the heart muscle.Research indicates that variant angina is caused by coro-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 194AnginaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 194', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 188}), Document(page_content='nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or\\nintensity to cause an actual heart attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAngina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-\\nness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster-num). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm,neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occurwhen the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond theoxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, thecondition is often precipitated by physical exertion. Inmost cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min-utes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica-tions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavymeals, cigarette smoking , and alcohol can also cause or\\ncontribute to an episode of angina.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians can usually diagnose angina based on the\\npatient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-er, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm orrule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-lying heart disease.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical\\nimpulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electricalactivity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioningproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-grams are also useful in investigating other possibleabnormal features of the heart.\\nStress test\\nFor many individuals with angina, the results of an\\nelectrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-malities. Because the symptoms of angina occur duringstress, the functioning of the heart may need to be evalu-ated under the physical stress of exercise. The stress test\\nrecords information from the electrocardiogram before,during, and after exercise in search of stress-relatedabnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured duringthe stress test and symptoms are noted. A more involvedand complex stress test (for example, thallium scanning)may be used in some cases to picture the blood flow inthe heart muscle during the most intense time of exerciseand after rest.\\nAngiogram\\nThe angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the\\ncoronary artery, has been noted to be the most accuratediagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of\\ncoronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexibletube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery located inthe forearm or groin. This catheter is passed furtherthrough the artery into one of the two major coronaryarteries. A dye is injected at that time to help the x rays“see” the heart and arteries more clearly. Many brief xrays are made to create a “movie” of blood flowingthrough the coronary arteries, which will reveal any pos-sible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow tothe heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.\\nTreatment\\nConservative treatment\\nArtery disease causing angina is addressed initially by\\ncontrolling existing factors placing the individual at risk.These risk factors include cigarette smoking, high bloodpressure, high cholesterol levels, and obesity . Angina is\\noften controlled by medication, most commonly withnitroglycerin. This drug relieves symptoms of angina byincreasing the diameter of the blood vessels carryingblood to the heart muscle. Nitroglycerin is taken wheneverdiscomfort occurs or is expected. It may be taken bymouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transder-mally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin. Inaddition, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers\\nmay be prescribed to also decrease the demand on theheart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart.\\nSurgical treatment\\nWhen conservative treatments are not effective in\\nthe reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attackremains high, physicians may recommend angioplasty\\nor surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an opera-tion in which a blood vessel (often a long vein surgicallyremoved from the leg) is grafted onto the blocked arteryto bypass the blocked portion. This newly formed path-way allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle.\\nAnother procedure used to improve blood flow to\\nthe heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, thephysician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the endinto a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then thread-ed up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflat-ed to open the vessel in narrowed sections. Other tech-niques using laser and mechanical devices are beingdeveloped and applied, also by means of catheters.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDuring an angina episode, relief has been noted by\\napplying massage or kinesiological methods, but thesetechniques are not standard recommendations by physi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 195AnginaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 195', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 189}), Document(page_content='cians. For example, one technique places the palm and\\nfingers of either hand on the forehead while simultane-ously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone) up anddown its entire length using the other hand. This is fol-lowed by additional massaging by the fingertip andthumb next to the sternum, on each side.\\nOnce the angina has subsided, the cause should be\\ndetermined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associat-ed cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, primari-ly including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugarand saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber. Both con-ventional and alternative medicine agree that increasingexercise and improving diet are important steps to reducehigh cholesterol levels. Alternative medicine has pro-posed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with sev-eral gaining the attention and interest of the public. Oneof the most recent popular treatments is garlic ( Allium\\nsativum ). Some studies have shown that adequate dosages\\nof garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%, LDL(bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL (good) choles-terol by 10%. Other studies have not shown significantbenefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as greatas that achieved by medications, garlic may possibly be ofbenefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol, with-out causing the side effects associated with cholesterol-\\nreducing drugs . Other herbal remedies that may help\\nlower cholesterol include alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ), fenu-\\ngreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ), Asian ginseng\\n(Panax ginseng ), and tumeric ( Curcuma longa ).\\nAntioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),\\nvitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxida-tive damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be aprecursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for a patient with angina depends on\\nits origin, type, severity, and the general health of theindividual. A person who has angina has the best progno-sis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learnsthe pattern of his or her angina, such as what causes theattacks, what they feel like, how long episodes usuallylast, and whether medication relieves the attacks. If pat-terns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symp-toms resemble those of a heart attack, medical helpshould be sought immediately.\\nPrevention\\nIn most cases, the best prevention involves changing\\none’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of angina. Ifblood pressure medication has been prescribed, compli-ance is a necessity and should be a priority as well.

Arteriography is\\na type of angiography that involves the study of the arteries.\\nPurpose\\nAngiography is used to detect abnormalities or\\nblockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions)throughout the circulatory system and in some organs.The procedure is commonly used to identify atheroscle-\\nrosis ; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney func-\\ntion and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect ananeurysm (an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rup-ture leading to hemorrhage), tumor, blood clot, or arteri-\\novenous malformations (abnormals tangles of arteries\\nand veins) in the brain; and to diagnose problems withthe retina of the eye. It is also used to give surgeons anaccurate “map” of the heart prior to open-heart surgery,or of the brain prior to neurosurgery.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients with kidney disease or injury may suffer\\nfurther kidney damage from the contrast mediums usedfor angiography. Patients who have blood clotting prob-lems, have a known allergy to contrast mediums, or areallergic to iodine, a component of some contrast medi-ums, may also not be suitable candidates for an angiogra-phy procedure. Because x rays carry risks of ionizingradiation exposure to the fetus, pregnant women are alsoadvised to avoid this procedure.\\nDescription\\nAngiography is usually performed at a hospital by a\\ntrained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse. Ittakes place in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite, and for mosttypes of angiograms, the patient’s vital signs will bemonitored throughout the procedure.\\nAngiography requires the injection of a contrast dye\\nthat makes the blood vessels visible to x ray. The dye isinjected through a procedure known as arterial puncture .\\nThe puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit,inside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antisep-tic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, asmall incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.A needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is insert-ed through the skin into the artery. When the radiologisthas punctured the artery with the needle, the stylet isremoved and replaced with another long wire called aguide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of the nee-dle before the guide wire is inserted.\\nThe guide wire is fed through the outer needle into\\nthe artery and to the area that requires angiographicstudy. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of the\\npatient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to thecorrect location. Once it is in position, the needle isremoved and a catheter is slid over the length of theguide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The guidewire is removed and the catheter is left in place in prepa-ration for the injection of the contrast medium, or dye.\\nDepending on the type of angiography procedure\\nbeing performed, the contrast medium is either injectedby hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected withan automatic injector connected to the catheter. Anautomatic injector is used frequently because it is ableto propel a large volume of dye very quickly to theangiogram site. The patient is warned that the injectionwill start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec-tion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possibleside effects or reactions include headache ,dizziness ,\\nirregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation,and chest pain , but they usually last only momentarily.\\nTo view the area of study from different angles or per-spectives, the patient may be asked to change positionsseveral times, and subsequent dye injections may beadministered. During any injection, the patient or thecamera may move.\\nThroughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray pic-\\ntures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving x rays) willbe taken. Because of the high pressure of arterial bloodflow, the dye will dissipate through the patient’s systemquickly, so pictures must be taken in rapid succession.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 197Angiography\\nAn angiogram of a coronary artery.

Pressure isapplied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for 10-20 minutes in order for clotting to take place and thearterial puncture to reseal itself. A pressure bandage isthen applied.\\nMost angiograms follow the general procedures out-\\nlined above, but vary slightly depending on the area ofthe vascular system being studied. A variety of commonangiography procedures are outlined below:\\nCerebral angiography\\nCerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms,\\nblood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the brain.The catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid arteryand the injected contrast medium travels through theblood vessels on the brain. Patients frequently experienceheadache, warmth, or a burning sensation in the head orneck during the injection portion of the procedure. Acerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete.\\nCoronary angiography\\nCoronary angiography is administered by a cardiol-\\nogist with training in radiology or, occasionally, by aradiologist. The arterial puncture is typically given in thefemoral artery, and the cardiologist uses a guide wire andcatheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray serieson the coronary arteries. The catheter may also be placedin the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aorticvalves of the heart. If the cardiologist requires a view ofthe right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pul-monic valves, the catheter will be inserted through alarge vein and guided into the right ventricle. Thecatheter also serves the purpose of monitoring bloodpressures in these different locations inside the heart. Theangiogram procedure takes several hours, depending onthe complexity of the procedure.\\nPulmonary angiography\\nPulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to\\nevaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also consid-ered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul-\\nmonary embolism . The procedure differs from cerebral\\nand coronary angiograms in that the guide wire andcatheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery, andare guided up through the chambers of the heart and intothe pulmonary artery. Throughout the procedure, thepatient’s vital signs are monitored to ensure that thecatheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias , or irregular heart-beats. The contrast medium is then injected into the pul-\\nmonary artery where it circulates through the lung capil-laries. The test typically takes up to 90 minutes.\\nKidney angiography\\nPatients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf-\\nfer further damage to their kidneys from the contrastmedium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they oftenrequire the test to evaluate kidney function. Thesepatients should be well-hydrated with a intravenoussaline drip before the procedure, and may benefit fromavailable medications (e.g., dopamine) that help to pro-tect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents.During a kidney angiogram, the guide wire and catheterare inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area andadvanced through the abdominal aorta, the main artery inthe abdomen, and into the renal arteries. The procedurewill take approximately one hour.\\nFluorescein angiography\\nFluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal\\nproblems and circulatory disorders. It is typically con-ducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s pupilsare dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and fore-head against a bracing apparatus to keep it still. Sodiumfluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a veinin the patient’s arm. The dye will travel through thepatient’s body and into the blood vessels of the eye. Theprocedure does not require x rays. Instead, a rapid seriesof close-up photographs of the patient’s eyes are taken,one set immediately after the dye is injected, and a sec-ond set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye hasmoved through the patient’s vascular system. The entireprocedure takes up to one hour.\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray\\nexploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterialbranches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to theabdomen and digestive system. The test is commonlyused to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs ofischemia in the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to\\nlocate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is alsoused in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, includ-ing portal hypertension , and cirrhosis . The procedure\\ncan take up to three hours, depending on the number ofblood vessels studied.\\nSplenoportography\\nA splenoportograph is a variation of an angiogram\\nthat involves the injection of contrast medium directlyinto the spleen to view the splenic and portal veins. It isused to diagnose blockages in the splenic vein and portal\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 198AngiographyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 198', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 192}), Document(page_content='vein thrombosis and to assess the strength and location of\\nthe vascular system prior to liver transplantation .\\nMost angiography procedures are typically paid for by\\nmajor medical insurance.

They must remove all jewelry before the procedureand change into a hospital gown. If the arterial punctureis to be made in the armpit or groin area, shaving may berequired. A sedative may be administered to relax thepatient for the procedure. An IV line will also be insertedinto a vein in the patient’s arm before the procedurebegins in case medication or blood products are requiredduring the angiogram.\\nPrior to the angiography procedure, patients will be\\nbriefed on the details of the test, the benefits and risks,KEY TERMS\\nArteriosclerosis —A chronic condition character-\\nized by thickening and hardening of the arteries andthe build-up of plaque on the arterial walls.

If the procedure is performed on anoutpatient basis, the patient is typically kept under closeobservation for a period of at six to 12 hours before beingreleased. If the arterial puncture was performed in thefemoral artery, the patient will be instructed to keep hisleg straight and relatively immobile during the observa-tion period. The patient’s blood pressure and vital signswill be monitored and the puncture site observed closely.Pain medication may be prescribed if the patient is expe-riencing discomfort from the puncture, and a cold pack isapplied to the site to reduce swelling. It is normal for thepuncture site to be sore and bruised for several weeks.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 199AngiographyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 199', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 193}), Document(page_content='The patient may also develop a hematoma, a hard mass\\ncreated by the blood vessels broken during the procedure.Hematomas should be watched carefully, as they mayindicate continued bleeding of the arterial puncture site.\\nAngiography patients are also advised to enjoy two\\nto three days of rest and relaxation after the procedure inorder to avoid placing any undue stress on the arterial\\npuncture.

The heart mayalso become irritated by the movement of the catheterthrough its chambers during pulmonary and coronaryangiography procedures, and arrhythmias may develop.\\nPatients who develop an allergic reaction to the con-\\ntrast medium used in angiography may experience a vari-ety of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty breath-ing,heart failure , or a sudden drop in blood pressure. If\\nthe patient is aware of the allergy before the test isadministered, certain medications can be administered atthat time to counteract the reaction.\\nAngiography involves minor exposure to radiation\\nthrough the x rays and fluoroscopic guidance used in theprocedure. Unless the patient is pregnant, or multipleradiological or fluoroscopic studies are required, thesmall dose of radiation incurred during a single proce-dure poses little risk. However, multiple studies requiringfluoroscopic exposure that are conducted in a short timeperiod have been known to cause skin necrosis in someindividuals. This risk can be minimized by careful moni-toring and documentation of cumulative radiation dosesadministered to these patients.\\nNormal results\\nThe results of an angiogram or arteriogram depend\\non the artery or organ system being examined. Generally,test results should display a normal and unimpeded flow\\nof blood through the vascular system.

Thereare various types of these procedures and their names areassociated with the type of vessel entry and equipmentused. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA) describes entry through the skin (percutaneous) andnavigates to the area of the vessel of interest through thesame vessel or one that communicates with it (translumi-nal). In the case of a procedure involving the coronaryarteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in thegroin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed throughthe aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteriesat the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve.\\nPurpose\\nIn individuals with an occulsive vascular disease\\nsuch as atherosclerosis , blood flow is impaired to an\\norgan (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such asthe lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen dueto fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This narrow-ing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere.Once the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flowis returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at thesame location and the procedure could be repeated.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 200AngioplastyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 200', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 194}), Document(page_content='Precautions\\nAngioplasty procedures are performed on hospital\\ninpatients in facilities for proper monitoring and recov-ery. If the procedure is to be performed in a coronaryartery, the patient’s care is likely to be provided by spe-cially trained physicians, nurses, and vascular specialists.Typically, patients are given anticoagulants prior to theprocedure to assist in the prevention of thromboses(blood clots). Administration of anticoagulants, however,may impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. Theprocedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidanceand contrast media. Since the decision to perform angio-plasty may have been made following a diagnosticangiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrastmedia is likely to known. The procedure may thenrequire the use of non-ionic contrast agents.\\nDescription\\nAngioplasty was originally performed by dilating the\\nvessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiffcatheters through the narrowed space. Complications ofthis procedure caused researchers to develop means ofwidening the vessel using a minimally sized device.Today, catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widenthe vessel and stents to provide structural support for thevessel. Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of thefat or calcium plaque. Catheters may also be equippedwith spinning wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque.\\nAngioplasty may be performed while the patient is\\nsedated or anesthetized, depending on the vesselsinvolved. If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-\\nplasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient will bekept awake to report on discomfort and cough if\\nrequired. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac\\ncatheterization labs with sophisticated monitoring\\ndevices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiologydepartment’s angiographic suite, the patient may besedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor thepatient’s vital signs during the procedure. If performedby a vascular surgeon, the angioplasty procedure will beperformed in an operating room or specially designedvascular procedure suite.\\nThe site of the introduction of the angioplasty equip-\\nment is prepared as a sterile surgical site. Although manyprocedures are performed by puncturing the vesselthrough skin, many procedures are also performed bysurgically exposing the site of entry. Direct view of thevessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to thevessel or excessive bleeding at the site. Once the vessel ispunctured and the guidewire is introduced, fluoroscopyis used to monitor small injections of contrast media usedto visualize the path through the vessel. If the fluo-roscopy system has a feature called ‘roadmap’, theamount of contrast media injected will be greater in orderto define the full route the guidewire will take. The fluo-roscopy system will then superimpose subsequentimages over the roadmap while the vessel is traversed,that is, the physician moves the guidewire along the mapto the destination.\\nHaving reached the area of stenosis, the physician\\nwill inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 201Angioplasty\\nBefore AfterAngioplasty\\nGuidewire\\nInadequate\\nflow\\nPlaqueLumenImproved\\nflowInflated\\nballoon\\nIn balloon angioplasty, plaque is pushed out of the clogged artery by the inflation of the balloon device.

Balloons are inflated in size\\nand duration depending on the size and location of thevessel. In some cases, the use of a stent (a mesh of wirethat resembles a Chinese finger puzzle) may also beused. The vessel may be widened before, during, or afterthe deployment of the stent. Procedures for deployingstents are dependent on the type of stent used. In caseswhere the vessel is tortuous or at intersections of vessels,the use of a graph may be necessary to provide structuralstrength to the vessel. Stents, graphs, and balloon dila-tion may all be used together or separately.\\nThe procedure is verified using fluoroscopy and\\ncontrast media to produce an angiogram or by usingintravascular ultrasound or both. All equipment is with-drawn from the vessel and the puncture site repaired.\\nRisks\\nDuring the procedure there is a danger of puncturing\\nthe vessel with the guidewire. This is a very small risk.Patients must be monitored for hematoma or hemorrhageat the puncture site. There is also a small risk of heart\\nattack , emboli, and although unlikely death .

They may be used alone or in combina-tion with other medicines for high blood pressure. Theywork by preventing a chemical in the blood, angiotensinI, from being converted into a substance that increasessalt and water retention in the body. Increased salt andwater retention lead to high blood pressure. ACEinhibitors also make blood vessels relax, which helpslower blood pressure and allows more oxygen-rich bloodto reach the heart.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 202Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 202', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 196}), Document(page_content='Treating high blood pressure is important because\\nthe condition puts a burden on the heart and the arteries,which can lead to permanent damage over time.

Taking ACE inhibitors\\nwith certain other drugs may affect the way the drugswork or may increase the chance of side effects.Side effects\\nThe most common side effect is a dry, continuing\\ncough . This usually does not subside unless the medica-\\ntion is stopped. Ask the physician if the cough can betreated. Less common side effects, such as headache ,\\nloss of taste, unusual tiredness, and nausea or diarrheaalso may occur and do not need medical attention unlessthey are severe or they interfere with normal activities.\\nMore serious side effects are rare, but may occur. If\\nany of the following side effects occur, check with aphysician immediately:\\n• swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, legs,\\nhands, or feet\\n• itchy skin• sudden breathing or swallowing problems\\n• chest pain\\n• hoarseness• sore throat• fever and chills• stomach pain• yellow eyes or skin\\nIn addition, anyone who has any of the following\\nsymptoms while taking an ACE inhibitor should checkwith his or her physician as soon as possible:\\n• dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting\\n• confusion• nervousness•f e v e r• joint pain• numbness or tingling in hands, feet, or lips\\n• weak or heavy feeling in the legs\\n• skin rash• irregular heartbeat• shortness of breath or other breathing problems\\nOther side effects may occur. Anyone who has\\nunusual symptoms after taking an ACE inhibitor shouldget in touch with his or her physician.\\nInteractions\\nACE inhibitors may interact with certain foods and\\nother medicines. For example, captopril (Capoten) inter-acts with food and should be taken one hour beforemeals. Anyone who takes ACE inhibitors should let thephysician know all other medicines he or she is takingand should ask about foods that should be avoided.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 204Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 204', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 198}), Document(page_content='Among the foods and drugs that may interact with ACE\\ninhibitors are:\\n• water pills (diuretics)\\n• lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder• tetracycline, an antibiotic• medicines or supplements that contain potassium• salt substitutes that contain potassium\\nThe list above may not include everything that inter-\\nacts with ACE inhibitors.

The primary function ofKEY TERMS\\nArteries —Blood vessels that carry blood away\\nfrom the heart to the cells, tissues, and organs ofthe body.\\nChronic —A word used to describe a long-lasting\\ncondition. Chronic conditions often develop grad-ually and involve slow changes.\\nEnzyme —A type of protein, produced in the body,\\nthat brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.\\nFetus —A developing baby inside the womb.\\nScleroderma —A disease that first affects the skin\\nand later affects certain internal organs. The firstsymptoms are the hardening, thickening, andshrinking of the skin.\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) —A chronic\\ndisease that affects the skin, joints, and certaininternal organs.\\nVenom —A poisonous substance secreted by an\\nanimal, usually delivered through a bite or a sting.ACE is to help regulate arterial pressure by converting\\nangiotensin I to angiotensin II.\\nPurpose\\nThe ACE test is used primarily to detect and monitor\\nthe clinical course of sarcoidosis (a disease that affects\\nmany organs, especially the lungs), to differentiatebetween sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to delin-eate between active and inactive sarcoid disease. Elevat-ed ACE levels are also found in a number of other condi-tions, including Gaucher’s disease (a rare familial disor-der of fat metabolism) and leprosy .\\nPrecautions\\nIt should be noted that people under 20 years of age\\nnormally have very high ACE levels. Decreased levels maybe seen in the condition of excess fat in the blood (hyper-lipidemia). Drugs that may cause decreased ACE levelsinclude ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.\\nDescription\\nACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone\\nmechanism which controls blood pressure by convertingangiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved inregulating blood pressure. Angiotensin I by itself is inac-tive, but when converted by ACE to the active form,angiotensin II, it causes narrowing of the small bloodvessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pres-sure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldos-terone, which causes an increase in blood pressure. Cer-tain kidney disorders increase the production ofangiotensin II, another cause of hypertension . Despite\\nthe action of ACE on blood pressure regulation, determi-nation of this enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluationof hypertension (high blood pressure).\\nPreparation\\nDetermination of ACE levels requires a blood sam-\\nple. The patient need not be fasting .\\nRisks\\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\\nslight bleeding from the puncture site, fainting or feeling\\nlightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (bloodaccumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nNormal ranges for this test are laboratory-specific\\nbut can range from 8-57 U/ml for patients over 20 yearsof age.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 205Angiotensin-converting enzyme testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 205', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 199}), Document(page_content='Abnormal results\\nSerum ACE levels are elevated in approximately 80-\\n90% of patients with active sarcoidosis.

Flores\\nAnimal bite infections\\nDefinition\\nThe most common problem following an animal bite\\nis simple infection. The saliva of dogs and cats is knownto contain a wide variety of bacteria. According to onerecent study, bacteria or other pathogens show up inabout 85 percent of bites. When an animal bites, it canthen transmit pathogens into the wound. These microor-ganisms may grow within the wound and cause an infec-tion. The consequences of infection range from mild dis-comfort to life-threatening complications.\\nDescription\\nTwo to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in\\nthe United States and about 1% of bites require hospital-ization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency roomvisits per year, which represents approximately 1% of allemergency hospital visits, at an annual cost of $100 mil-lion dollars in health care expenses and lost income.KEY TERMS\\nSarcoidosis —Sarcoidosis is a rare disease of\\nunknown cause in which inflammation occurs inlymph nodes and other tissues throughout thebody, usually the lungs, skin, liver, and eyes.Children are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with\\n5-9 year-old boys having the highest incidence. Men aremore often bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereaswomen are more often bitten by cats (3:1).\\nDog bites make up 80-85% of all reported incidents.\\nCats account for about 10% of reported bites, and otheranimals (including rodents, rabbits, horses, raccoons,bats, skunks, and monkeys) make up the remaining 5-10%. Cat bites become infected more frequently thandog bites. A dog’s mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15-20% of dog bites become infected. In contrast, approxi-mately 30-50% of cat bites become infected.\\nMany factors contribute to the infection rates, such\\nas, for example, the type of wound inflicted, the locationof the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bittenperson, the extent of delay before treatment, patient com-pliance and the presence of a foreign body in the wound.Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because they haverounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adultdog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pres-sure. This pressure usually results in a crushing injury,causing damage to deep structures such as bones, bloodvessels, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dog canine teethare also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerations.Cats, with their needle-like fangs, typically cause punc-ture wounds . Puncture wounds appear innocuous on the\\nsurface, but the underlying injury goes deep. Cat teethessentially inject bacteria into the bite, and the deep, nar-row wound is difficult to clean. Persons with impairedimmunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIVinfection—are especially vulnerable to infection.\\nThe bacterial species most commonly found in bite\\nwounds include Pasteurella multocida ,Staphylococcus\\naureus ,Pseudomonas sp , and Streptococcus sp . P . multoci-\\nda, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominent\\nin cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animalbites include cat-scratch disease ,tetanus and rabies .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common sign of infection from an animal\\nbite is inflammation. The skin around the wound is redand feels warm, and the wound may exude pus. Nearbylymph glands may be swollen. Complications can arise ifthe infection is not treated and spreads into deeper struc-tures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is deep or occurson the hand or at a joint, complications are more likely.\\nLive, disease-causing bacteria within the blood-\\nstream and tissues cause complications far from thewound site. Such complications include meningitis ,\\nbrain abscesses, pneumonia and lung abscesses, and\\nheart infections, among others. These complications canbe fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage joints\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 206Animal bite infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 206', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\adity\\\\Desktop\\\\Chat UI\\\\Data\\\\Medical_Gale.pdf', 'page': 200})]\n"
